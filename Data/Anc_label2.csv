I'm very happy with the speedy delivery, flavor, and these Chipss will be long gone before their expiration date is even thought of (October 2010).

13,,,,,,The Chipss were broken up in the cups. So never ate a whole Chips. Very salty. I will not buy again. ,Review 14
14,cheap,cheap,,,,Good deal. Way cheaper than byung them in the smaller packs at the store. And you get single servings so I don't eat the whole can. ,Review 15

16,Sweet,,,Sweet,,"Yes, it's very bad for us, however, it's such a great little snack for special occasions.  I bought a case of these for the twins' birthday party, and they were a huge hit with kids and adults!  They will now be a kid party stable at our house. ",Review 17

20,cheap,cheap,,,,These are always good tasting but I especially like getting them in the snack sizes because it keeps me from eating too many of them at once. The problem with getting them shipped is that most of the Chipss came broken into pieces. ,Review 21

26,Sweet,Sweet,,,,"We loved these Chipss.  The thing that upset me was this was on the bottom of the package with no protection.  The airbags near it were flat.  The whole row and over half the other the Chipss were busted up.  Amazon corrected the situation.  The Chipss we were able to eat were fresh and tasty,. ",Review 27

44,,,,,,These are Great. If you don't want to give the kids to much. Just give them one or two Snack Stacks Packs and send them on their way. You won't have to worry about them eating to much because you control how much they will be getting. ,Review 45

46,Spicy,,,Spicy,,"Love potato Chipss but I can't stand the fact that they can go stale so fast once they've been open.  I used to have packages on top of the refrigerator with 2 handfuls of Chipss in them even though they had been resealed, clipped and re-clipped.  We had seen the 6 pack of regular Pringles in the store and started purchasing them.  Couldn't find the assorted flavors until I went to Amazon (in this day and age of gas prices, I go there quite often rather than drive around to many stores).  Love the assorted packs, Thank you Amazon. ",Review 47
47,,,,,,I love buying all snacks size packs.  After schools kids are hungry and these are easy for them to grab and not fill up on.  The price is just as good as the warehouse prices. ,Review 48
48,cheap,,,cheap,,"I always loved Pringles, but I could finish a can in a very short time. When I saw these individualized packs, I was excited. Even better was that they came in a variety pack. There are regular, cheddar cheese, and sour cream and onion. My friend was so pleased with the product that he wanted a package for himself. I am on my second box and I am thrilled! They come 36 in a box so they last a good long time. I highly recommend them. ",Review 49
49,cheap,cheap,,,,To me this is an excellent value........I am a piggy when it comes to Chipss and packaged in the individual packs is perfect.  Makes one stop & think before devouring the whole carton.  One pack or two at a time.....perfect. ,Review 50
50,,,,,,i am a big fan of these ... you can find them cheap and as long as you eat them within 3 or 4 days they are moist and chewy.  normally i buy my bagels from a bagel store but if you're short on funds or want yummy snacks aorund the house to feed your friends these are a good call.  also good with cream cheese of course. ,Review 51
51,,,,,,"I like to review books and an occasional dvd -----I have never reviewed a food product.  But.............after tasting an ""Everything Bagel"" a few days ago, I am compelled to rave about it somewhere.  It was REALLY great  --  ate half with cream cheese and half with butter.  The taste is a wonderful and delicious mix of very chewable seeds along with a crispy outer and soft inner roll.<br /><br />This was a fortunate find because sometimes breakfast can be a little boring with just toast or a muffin.  These bagels are so good, I find myself thinking about them occasionally during odd hours.  Yes, they are that good. ",Review 52
52,cheap,,,cheap,,Tasted like a couple of pieces of toast.  Anyone who likes bagels should stay away from these. ,Review 53
53,,,,,,These took awhile to get here but they were still good and tasted fine. Considering the price though I am not sure I would order these again since I can get them a lot cheaper in the stores. ,Review 54
54,Veg,Veg,,,,"I normally do not like the high protein breads, but this was really good!  The texture was not rubbery and is packed full of protein that kept me full for hours! ",Review 55
55,Sweet,,,Sweet,,Wanted a high protein breakfast food and this is it.  A little bit chewy but it doesn't change the taste.  Best tasting bagel when looking for high protein food. ,Review 56
56,,,,,,"I ordered these kosher bagels twice in the past month.  The first time they came within 2 days or so, and they still had that fresh bagel aroma.  They are not quite as chewy or big as the ones my Bubbe used to get in Queens, but still good.  The second time, there was a delay of about 2 days before shipping, plus 2-3 days to get to us in Tennessee.  Although they weren't stale, the flavor naturally wasn't quite as good. The bakery, Davidovich of New York, included a 7th bagel for free.  (Maybe as compensation? Anyway, thank you!)  Their enclosed card marks a location on a map in midtown Manhattan, but the package was shipped from Woodside, Queens.<br />The bagels are good enough that I may try them again.  It would be nice if they would offer some varieties other than Plain.  How about Poppy Seed, Onion, Egg, Sesame, or ""Everything""?<br />Also, I urge the seller to provide better packaging for shipment around the country, perhaps a vacuum seal, since the shipping method is UPS Ground.<br />FLASH (11/5/09): The seller has now more than doubled the price of the 6 bagels, from $4.50 to $9.50, PLUS it's still $5.49 shipping -- way too expensive, in my opinion!  Maybe they intended to provide FREE shipping, which would be a $.50 reduction vs. the previous total? ",Review 57
57,,,,,,"Yes, that is correct. This type of bagel sold through Amazon,  you could get in the local supermarkets in Queens, NY. , for about $5.00 a dozen. There ok , but not as good as the one's made in the bagel shops. Those made in and for the bagel shops were very special and cost around $10.00 a dozen. ",Review 58
58,Spicy,,,Spicy,,"Do not order these bagels the texture is like a hamburger bun and the taste is not like a true bagel, ",Review 59
59,Sweet,Sweet,,,,"These are not bagels. If you want Parker House Rolls then buy these. If you want real bagels, don't waste your money. We gave ours away they were so bad we could not eat them.  If there was a half star rating I would give that rating. ",Review 60
60,,,,,,"Time - Was suppose to arrived in a few days but arrievd next day.<br /><br /> Taste - Absolutely delicious, worth to buy, and most of all stays very fresh.<br /><br />Packed - Was well packed and easy to serve.<br /><br />Bottom Line - If you're looking for fresh bagels and a easy way to get it to you house, this is your answer!<br /><br />Enjoy!

61,cheap,,,cheap,,I was very disappointed in these what you are calling bagels. .  They are NOT bagels and I will never order them again. ,Review 62
62,,,,,,"Perfect Bagels, nice size, great texture. Put them in the freezer to keep them fresh longer, or pop one in the toaster for a quick fix treat. ",Review 63
63,,,,,,WOW!  This one is truly a NY bagel.  It is the best tasting bagel I have ever tried.  Excellent with cream cheese and lox! ,Review 64
64,,,,,,These come up in a search for low carb items but yet there is no nutritional data I could find anywhere.  I am not taking the chance. ,Review 65
65,Sweet,,,Sweet,,"I have been eating bagles all of my life and these are the worst. they look like big rolls and taste like heavy bread.  i ate one with lox and cream chese and it sat in my tummy like a ball of lead for 2 days.  I tried to give them to my neighbors with no luck after they tasted them and made a sick face and spit it out. the worst part is very funny to other people because I ordered 8 dozen for over $80.00.  I have been buying from Amazon for years and have never sent anything back, and this is the 1st review I have written about products that I got from Amazon . I did not return them because by the time they would have received them they would have been stale and god knows what the shipping would have coat Amazon. If you buy them go fishing and you can use them a sinkers.<br />amazon.Well it pay to learn, that what my pappy used to say.  these were not purchased from Amazon. The shipper was LILLYS HOME STYLE OUT OF NEW YORK.  i WENT TO WALL MART AND GOT SOME GOOD LADNERS BAGLES SO I COULD EAT MY LOX. GOOD BUY  TWIGGY ",Review 66
66,,,,,,"MM's Review:  I enjoy these bagels as one of the most delicious -ly important source of protein in my daily meal plan.  If possible, I like to have at least 2 to 3 servings per day.  These plain bagels are low in sodium, fat without adding any toppings and not too bad for the gluten- intolerant person.  One of the blueberry bagel is sweet enough by itself for a natural carbohydrate treat!  There are nutritional and life sustaining value when one has a consumable meal or snack of this yummy and worthy bread for life to satisfy one's hunger.  Thank you to the baker's of these tasty bagel's. ",Review 67
67,Spicy,Spicy,,,,Thomas' makes incredible English Muffins.  The people who designed their bagels have never had bagels.  Thomas' Bagels are Bagel shaped bread.  There is nothing bagel about it. ,Review 68
68,cheap,,,cheap,,"I really liked the light sugar taste. not overly sugary, but a yummy cinnamon flavor and a very nice treat! taste like normal bagel chips except that they are gluten- free. Glutino does a great job here. ",Review 69

71,,,,,,Great snack any time of the day. Good flavor and not too hard. Easy to carry anywhere. Even my granddaughter likes to eat them ,Review 72
72,,,,,,"Delicious and came in relatively whole state. Maybe a broken one here and there, but since they are cinnamon and sugar bagel chips it does not matter. ",Review 73
73,,,,,,"These are basically bagel chips that have the tiniest hint of cinnamon and sugar. If you look at the chips themselves you won't even see cinnamon and sugar on the coating. If you think the flavor is in the chip itself, wrong again. I won't be purchasing these again. What a let down Glutino. ",Review 74
74,,,,,,"The coating falls off or it just wasn't on there enough in the first place. I wanted to be able to have the same kind of experience as snacking on cinnamon and sugar cereal, but this just has a hint of sweet and cinnamon. If I put it into dip, the flavor has to come from the dip and then why bother. I won't waste my money again. ",Review 75
75,,,,,,"The product is definitely better than average.  Unfortunately after the product is shipped too much of the crackers is but crumbs.  I actually called to complain to the shipping company who very graciously sent out replacements.  I had hoped that the new batch would be more intact.  It was perhaps marginally better.  Glutino should work on the packaging as so much of their product is excellent, especially their rosemary and olive oil crackers. ",Review 76
76,,,,,,"These chips taste even better than non-gluten free bagel chips.  I couldn't believe I went through a box in no time at all (Scary!).  Unfortunately, Amazon's price of this writing, six bucks a box, is beyond crazy!  The boxes aren't very big to begin with!  I paid about four bucks at my local grocery store, and I've seen them on sale for less than three, so shop around! ",Review 77
77,,,,,,"I was noticing that our stores weren't always offering the plain gluten free bagel chips without dairy. I love eating these as a snack, but it is fantastic to have real croutons on my salad again. Thank goodness I can still find them at Amazon. ",Review 78
78,,,,,,"Even now a days it can be difficult to find gluten free products in the local grocery stores routinely. Amazon comes through again. These are great for snacking, putting on salads. We use them in place of bread crumbs, a big hit. ",Review 79

So good my 2 yr old is trying to eat it all. Another snack food reclaimed! ",Review 82
82,,,,,,"The crunchy texture is great. My son discovered my Parmesan garlic stash at home. When he heard he couldn't because it contains casein (cow's milk protein) he was very insistent. So I checked and found these. He's such a happy camper. If you have the type of person in your life living the GF CF diet, these are great in flavor and texture. Also glad I read that the package has improved so that there aren't so many crumbs. ",Review 83

84,cheap,cheap,,,,"I never liked gluten free bread, but I am in love with these bagel chips. They are quite small, but very tasty. For those of us who went gluten free but miss the taste of bread-based snacks - this one is great! Not just OK, but great. But beware: they are addictive :-_ ",Review 85
85,,,,,,But the first pg I opened was mostly crumbs. I picked out the few whole chips and will use the crumbs for soup or toppings. They taste good but I hope the other 5 pgs are more chips and less crumbs. ,Review 86

94,Veg,Veg,,,,"These are the closest thing to ""real"" food I can find gluten-free so far. They taste just like regular bagel chips and are versitile.  I use them in place of chips and crackers.  Only problem I have is my local grocery does not restock them often, so I'm left ordering in bulk.  Online sites all seems to run close to Amazon's price, though here it's a dollar or so cheaper.  The grocery store is less, but they are tough for me to get. ",Review 95

I continued that tradition with my daughter who moved to TX three years ago. I ordered these on Sunday to send to my daughter in Waco, TX. She'd been bugging me for a week or so and hunting NY Bagels on the internet yielded several highly rated bagel shops that ship. All were cost prohibitive due to shipping charges, not the bagels themselves. Well, you never know from a picture or user reviews (often they are written by paid reviewers who&#8217;ve never sampled the product).

When I was on Weight Watchers I would use no-fat egg substitute instead of eggs and apple sauce instead of oil, and each muffin would only be 2 points. And They.Are.Yummy. Now that I'm off WW, I still make them the same way because they taste just as good, and who needs the extra fat. I also like them because of the fiber and that's all I'll say about that. I used to get them at a warehouse store (3 packs), but that store stopped selling them. They are not cheap in the regular grocery store, so a friend recommended I see if they sell them through Amazon's subscription service and they did! Still not as cheap as they used to be at the warehouse store, BUT with the free shipping, they are much cheaper than going out the store and buying them. I eat two muffins a day, every day. LOVE them.",Review 117
117,Veg,,,Veg,,"These muffins are awesome!! I thought that they would be just okay which I would have been fine with since I need healthy snacks but they blew me away. The taste is amazing (better than any other mix I have ever made). I did use applesauce instead of oil and used egg whites instead of whole eggs. I only baked them until toothpick came out clean *for me that was 15 minutes. The tops weren't brown at the point but that is okay since I like to reheat muffins in the toaster oven which browns them up nicely. I personally do not like huge blueberries in my muffins so I was happy to see that they are little pieces. I am going to do subscribe & save now since I know I will be eating a LOT of these yummy treats. The banana ones are okay but you can definitely taste the ""healthy"" aspect to them.

369,Spicy,,,Spicy,,"I decided to buy this product based on Hanson's reputation for quality natural beverages. I was hoping for a healthier alternative to the numerous products of dubious quality available in the local stores.  Unfortunately, the second ingrediant in this drink is sugar, and it tastes like it, too. Somewhere in the neighborhood of Mountain Dew if memory serves me correctly. If you like super sweet drinks and don't mind high doses of refined sugar, you probably won't have a problem with this product. It does give an energy boost (though it took two cans), but it has the expected rapid sugar crash when it wears off. If you drink Monster, Red Bull etc., Hanson's won't be a step down, but for those looking for an energy boost without the crap and the side effects, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N0TPVQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-7330441-7954855"">SAMBAZON Organic Amazon Energy Drink, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

But if you try it and dont like it please dont leave a bad review or low star rating based only on opinion. Hansen's has lower carbonation, lower caffeine, and lower sugar. It is the taste that has everybody hooked on it. Just because you dont like the taste, there is no need to say negative things when it is not a quality control issue. Also in my experience any problems with packaging is the handling from delivery guys flying over railroad tracks or tossing stuff around. I highly recommend ordering this from amazon ",Review 380

It never comes in on the truck. Hansen is flooded with calls complaining that it is no longer available locally. The rep said that she is going to talk to the owner and call me back after their March meeting. We will see what happens. I was willing to drive to the factory 20 mins from me but they would not sell it to me. Hmmm was it part of the contract with amazon to pull it from the local stores so we would have to buy it online for a higher price?

It was effective in terms of providing energy, but the taste wasn't quite right.

First, it tastes way better than Red Bull. Secondly, it gives you sustained energy for hours with no crash and burn like other energy drinks. The only problem drinking Hansen's is sometimes forgetting it's 7 pm or after, because at 3 a.m. I'm still wide awake and full of energy. Whatever Hansen's did, their scientists came up with a formula that beats other energy drinks hands down, including Sobe and many others. And do not be fooled by the cheaper price. Hansen's Energy Pro is the best energy drink on the market, like you've drank some magic elixir that transforms you from being lifeless to full of life. The energy boost lasts many hours at an even level, void of rapid heart beat or fidgety nerves. I have experienced no side effects other than feeling great. So, stellar job Hansen's. ",Review 399

400,Veg,,,Veg,,"The concept is great. My concern is how sugary they are. ""No sugar added""- true....sorta. They use concentrated apples which is effectively adding sugar, just not the heavily processed variety.<br /><br />At just over 3oz, each pouch has 12.3g of sugar. Granted that's not a whole lot, but I've been seeing more and more of this type of thing pop up. They tout it as no-sugar-added but they'll stir in a ton of concentrated pear or grape juice which is loaded with sugar! Fructose or glucose, it's all the same in your bloodstream.<br /><br />We've been giving our daughter unsweetened applesauce and now tasting this stuff it's dramatically more sweet. If you don't want your children to have sugar/get used to sugary tasting foods, then this is not the applesauce for you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the product is fantastic.

Huge advantages are that they fit nicely into back packs, no spoon requirement, one had eating action, and a great quick snack. If they can put more stuff into travel pack like this, I would eat and drink everything from pouches. One complaint is the packaging. They waste way too much packing material for the bulk box. It's 4 pouches inside a card board box, then 12 of those boxes in another box. I don't plan of selling these goodies so I can do without the extra packaging.

He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time.

These taste much better than a store brand we tried. Without actually having both around at once, my kids say they think the peach and apple taste about the same. I actually think the peach is more tart, and I'm going to get the 48 pack of appleapple next time. Having tried apple-strawberry and apple-banana in the store brand, I'm not going to risk those flavors in a 48-pack, even though I'm sure GoGo SqueeZ would taste a least a little better. One of my kids hated the strawberry and neither really liked the banana (although I think I would personally like the GoGo banana).<br /><br />These are super-convenient and the kids grab them first for their lunches and healthy snacks. I would give them 5 stars if they were just a little bigger. They seem to be gone before you know it. They are 3.2 oz and applesauce cups are 4 oz. My kids never take the cups though, because they don't want to hassle with the spoon and mess. The only thing I would warn people about with these is that everyone I've seen try them baulks a little at first--maybe it's the getting used to drinking your applesauce thing. Kids and adults, both seem to need to give it another try after first thinking they don't really like it. Now my kids love it and I find myself grabbing them frequently too.<br /><br />Should you buy the 48-pack if you've never tried it? I asked myself if I could handle eating them all myself if the kids wouldn't (my answer was yes), so I think that's a good way to decide. You could also always donate them, although they're a little pricey for that. I think you should start with the appleapple first if you've never tried any (assuming you and your kids do like applesauce). ",Review 434

Packing lunches, breakfast, etc. Having these pouches sure does make it easy to get a little bit of fruit in my daughter's (10) lunch, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids bigger/older. It's just not enough and it's too expensive for what you get. The applesauce inside isn't bad, but it's definitely not Mott's chunky. And depending on your child, a lot of applesauce is wasted because they don't squeeze it all out of the pouch. The cap can be tough for some younger kids to open too. But the idea has merit and for those who want a little (keyword: little) applesauce with their lunch or snack, this is easy to bring along. ",Review 445

I never believed it until I bought some of these on sale at walmart. I wake up in the morning and chug down one of my &#34;apple sauce juice boxes&#34; and feel like a human being rather than the walking dead 60% faster. And although they do contain some concentrated juice, they have a lot more natural ingredients than a lot of the processed meal bars and such I feel up to eating at the crack of dawn. And yes, I seriously feel an energy boost after eating them, although I can't promise that it's not psychological.<br /><br />I've tried the Apple Berry and the Mango. I liked both but the Mango is an acquired taste, I think because no one else I know liked it. These have 60 calories, fit in your purse, natural ingredients, and take about a minute to eat.

When the noodles got here I followed the cooking directions and seasoned them using my favorite sauce. Then I took the first big bite. This was a mistake! The noodles have a slimey, rubbery texture that kind of pops when you bite into it. All I could imagine was that this is what eating worms must feel like. I managed to choke down the first bite and tried one more time just to be sure, but I just couldn't finish another bite. I was so disappointed.

I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all!

After rinsing I tossed them into a stir fry pan with various veggies some spices and a bit of soy sauce and except for the slightly tougher texture the dish came out tasting like noodle take out from our local Chinese restaurant.  I wouldn't think they would hold up as well in a traditional spaghetti style dish but when prepared with a thinner sauce and left to cook long enough to absorb the other flavors of the dish they can be quite tasty.

They are shipped in a liquid filled bag (which doesn't smell too pleasant) and before I prepare them I rinse them at least 3 times and separate them with my hands under running water to make sure I rinsed off all of the liquid. They take a minute to cook and are basically flavorless. They soak up the flavor of whatever they are cooked in so I like to cook them in broth or salty water. After they are cooked, I drain them, rinse them again and then lay them out to drain some more on a towel. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but being able to enjoy a bowl of ""pasta"" after a long week is definitely worth the effort and there's no guilt afterwards! There are two servings per bag, but I eat both of them as they actually count as a vegetable serving. If you are used to angel hair sized pasta, this should be an easy adjustment. ENJOY! ",Review 467

The trick to shirataki/konnyaku is to let them sit in a flavor rich sauce so they absorb the flavor. Don't prepare them plain and expect them to taste good, cuz they won't. They don't really taste or smell fishy to anyone who actually knows what fish smells and tastes like, but they do have a different odor. Lately my favorite preparation is to parboil them, then soak in an Alfredo sauce prepared with Cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. A ramen restaurant near me recently started giving the option of shirataki noodles in place of wheat noodles, so I've been meaning to try them as an instant ramen or instant udon replacement because they are awesome in ramen!!

Just reordered; I hope to make this a diet staple. Also, I split this initial order with a friend because we were so concerned about the reviews.

497,,,,,,"Was skeptical but had to try these for myself.  Like the other reviews they do smell a bit, not a turnoff smell though.  After you rinse in water then boil for a minute or so the smell is completely gone.  Then I sauteed in a pan w/tbsp olive oil added ground ginger and garlic, fresh parsly, tsp. yellow mustard, tsp. sugar free ketchup and 3 tbsp soy sauce and sauteed with fresh broccoli...was delis h.  I would recommend to people and just be creative with how you prepare them.  Next time I will make Pad Thai love that dish and these will work great.  Maybe I'll use the fettucini shaped ones.  All the styles of noodles are made the same just different shapes to choose from. ",Review 498
