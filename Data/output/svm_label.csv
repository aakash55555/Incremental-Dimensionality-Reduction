116,"I have been using this product for about 3 years now. When I was on Weight Watchers I would use no-fat egg substitute instead of eggs and apple sauce instead of oil, and each muffin would only be 2 points. And They.Are.Yummy. Now that I'm off WW, I still make them the same way because they taste just as good, and who needs the extra fat. I also like them because of the fiber and that's all I'll say about that. I used to get them at a warehouse store (3 packs), but that store stopped selling them. They are not cheap in the regular grocery store, so a friend recommended I see if they sell them through Amazon's subscription service and they did! Still not as cheap as they used to be at the warehouse store, BUT with the free shipping, they are much cheaper than going out the store and buying them. I eat two muffins a day, every day.

117,"These muffins are awesome!! I thought that they would be just okay which I would have been fine with since I need healthy snacks but they blew me away. The taste is amazing (better than any other mix I have ever made). I did use applesauce instead of oil and used egg whites instead of whole eggs. I only baked them until toothpick came out clean *for me that was 15 minutes. The tops weren't brown at the point but that is okay since I like to reheat muffins in the toaster oven which browns them up nicely. I personally do not like huge blueberries in my muffins so I was happy to see that they are little pieces.

304,"Nutri-Grain bars are relatively healthy snack bars that can even serve as a meal replacement if your a light eater or you eat a couple of them. I really like the apple flavor, and so I am disappointed that this box breaks down into 1/3 apple and 2/3 strawberry. It would be nice if they offered a 48 pack of just the apple flavor. I do find that easting more than one of these can be a chore as they are a bit dry, so its best to have some water on hand when you eat them. I use these when I'm hungry enough to start eating something worse for me like a candy bar or other unhealthy food. They're sort of a fill in for sugar based snacks, and for that purpose, they're perfect. I keep some in my car and in my desk. They taste ok; not fantastic, but good enough. These are NOT protein or meal replacement bars, and will NOT fill you up if you eat just one. They're a snack only. If you want something more filling, check out the South Beach Diet Protein Bars.

These taste much better than a store brand we tried. Without actually having both around at once, my kids say they think the peach and apple taste about the same. I actually think the peach is more tart, and I'm going to get the 48 pack of appleapple next time. Having tried apple-strawberry and apple-banana in the store brand, I'm not going to risk those flavors in a 48-pack, even though I'm sure GoGo SqueeZ would taste a least a little better. One of my kids hated the strawberry and neither really liked the banana (although I think I would personally like the GoGo banana).<br /><br />These are super-convenient and the kids grab them first for their lunches and healthy snacks. I would give them 5 stars if they were just a little bigger. They seem to be gone before you know it. They are 3.2 oz and applesauce cups are 4 oz. My kids never take the cups though, because they don't want to hassle with the spoon and mess. The only thing I would warn people about with these is that everyone I've seen try them baulks a little at first--maybe it's the getting used to drinking your applesauce thing. Kids and adults, both seem to need to give it another try after first thinking they don't really like it. Now my kids love it and I find myself grabbing them frequently too.<br /><br />Should you buy the 48-pack if you've never tried it? I asked myself if I could handle eating them all myself if the kids wouldn't (my answer was yes), so I think that's a good way to decide. You could also always donate them, although they're a little pricey for that.

493,I received these today and can say anyone whining about the smell is a baby the smell isn't that bad even before washing them. They have absolutely NO TASTE which is great because they can go with anything. I tried them plain and no taste at all then I reheated some chili I made for dinner last night and it came out great mixed in. I would recommend that you start out with a smaller or thinner product when first trying them. Just realized I did order the Angel hair but received fettuccini but will be keeping them anyway since I already ate some. They do have a weird texture but with anything new it will take some getting used to & it's not so weird you can't eat it. I saw others claiming it was like jello but it's more like a noodle not cooked completely. ,9,pasta,I received today say anyone whining smell baby smell bad even washing them.

496,"Appreciated all the reviews... I already knew to rinse in cold water and then boil for 5 min. before it arrived. It barely smelled when I opened it, and only when I stuck my nose to it was there a mild fishy smell. Gone by the time I rinsed the noodles. After boiling, I added to a can of Progresso Lite Vegetable soup for a minute or two. Tasted/felt very similar to ramen noodles, but from what I've read, this is a whole lot healthier. Just reordered; I hope to make this a diet staple. Also, I split this initial order with a friend because we were so concerned about the reviews. She also added it to Progresso Lite Soup and had similar opinion. This product is probably best for someone who already eats healthy.

534,"I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I ""overcooked"" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order.
