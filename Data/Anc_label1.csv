In the online learning setting, where new inputinstances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented byadding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); thenumber of new units is determined by the current performance (representationerror) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate.Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity)on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at eachiteration of our online alternating minimization scheme, which iterates betweenthe code and dictionary updates.

However, the vast majority ofmedical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protectthe confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected healthinformation (PHI) that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manualde-identification is impractical given the size of EHR databases, the limitednumber of researchers with access to the non-de-identified notes, and thefrequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identificationsystem would consequently be of high value.  Materials and Methods: We introduce the first de-identification system basedon artificial neural networks (ANNs), which requires no handcrafted features orrules, unlike existing systems. We compare the performance of the system withstate-of-the-art systems on two datasets: the i2b2 2014 de-identificationchallenge dataset, which is the largest publicly available de-identificationdataset, and the MIMIC de-identification dataset, which we assembled and istwice as large as the i2b2 2014 dataset.  Results: Our ANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems.

Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namelyMatch-SR, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor isconstructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN isapplied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importancedetermined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculatedbased on the global interaction. We show that, after degenerated to the exactmatching scenario, Match-SRNN can approximate the dynamic programming processof longest common subsequence.

We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastableregions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. Thespectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractionsaligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of thesequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. Theconnectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills oroptions. These skills are independent of the learning task and can beefficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. Thisapproach works well even without the exact model of the environment by usingsample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate.

To support this observation, we rewriteresidual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditionalmodels, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion studyreveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they donot strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths areshorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed duringtraining, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most ofthe gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that areonly 10-34 layers deep.

The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latenttopic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN andglobal (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work oncontextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empiricalresults on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextualRNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised featureextractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB moviereview dataset and report an error rate of $6.28\%$. This is comparable to thestate-of-the-art $5.91\%$ resulting from a semi-supervised approach.

Specifically, we design anew model called Deep Reconstruction-Classification Network (DRCN), whichjointly learns a shared encoding representation for two tasks: i) supervisedclassification of labeled source data, and ii) unsupervised reconstruction ofunlabeled target data.In this way, the learnt representation not only preservesdiscriminability, but also encodes useful information from the target domain.Our new DRCN model can be optimized by using backpropagation similarly as thestandard neural networks.  We evaluate the performance of DRCN on a series of cross-domain objectrecognition tasks, where DRCN provides a considerable improvement (up to ~8% inaccuracy) over the prior state-of-the-art algorithms. Interestingly, we alsoobserve that the reconstruction pipeline of DRCN transforms images from thesource domain into images whose appearance resembles the target dataset. Thissuggests that DRCN's performance is due to constructing a single compositerepresentation that encodes information about both the structure of targetimages and the classification of source images. Finally, we provide a formalanalysis to justify the algorithm's objective in domain adaptation context.",Deep Reconstruction-Classification Networks for Unsupervised Domain  Adaptation
333,Physics,Physics,,,,Finding the most effective way to aggregate multi-subject fMRI data is along-standing and challenging problem. It is of increasing interest incontemporary fMRI studies of human cognition due to the scarcity of data persubject and the variability of brain anatomy and functional response acrosssubjects. Recent work on latent factor models shows promising results in thistask but this approach does not preserve spatial locality in the brain. Weexamine two ways to combine the ideas of a factor model and a searchlight basedanalysis to aggregate multi-subject fMRI data while preserving spatiallocality. We first do this directly by combining a recent factor method knownas a shared response model with searchlight analysis. Then we design amulti-view convolutional autoencoder for the same task. Both approachespreserve spatial locality and have competitive or better performance comparedwith standard searchlight analysis and the shared response model applied acrossthe whole brain.

Most existing work on sequential screening targetsthe context of tuning parameter selection, where one screens and solves asequence of $N$ lasso problems with a fixed grid of geometrically spacedregularization parameters. In contrast, we focus on the scenario where a targetregularization parameter has already been chosen via cross-validated modelselection, and we then need to solve many lasso instances using this fixedvalue. In this context, we propose and explore a feedback controlled sequentialscreening scheme. Feedback is used at each iteration to select the next problemto be solved. This allows the sequence of problems to be adapted to theinstance presented and the number of intermediate problems to be automaticallyselected.

Toaddress today's ever increasing large dataset, effective screening relies on atight region bound on the solution to the dual lasso. Typical region bounds arein the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple half spaces. One way totighten the region bound is using more half spaces, which however, adds to theoverhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lassoscreening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimizationproblem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned bythe normals of the half spaces. This property converts an optimization problemin high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing thecomputation overhead of lasso screening based on tighter region bounds.",The Symmetry of a Simple Optimization Problem in Lasso Screening

337,,,,,,"In this paper, we deal with two challenges for measuring the similarity ofthe subject identities in practical video-based face recognition - thevariation of the head pose in uncontrolled environments and the computationalexpense of processing videos. Since the frame-wise feature mean is unable tocharacterize the pose diversity among frames, we define and preserve theoverall pose diversity and closeness in a video. Then, identity will be theonly source of variation across videos since the pose varies even within asingle video. Instead of simply using all the frames, we select those faceswhose pose point is closest to the centroid of the K-means cluster containingthat pose point. Then, we represent a video as a bag of frame-wise deep facefeatures while the number of features has been reduced from hundreds to K.Since the video representation can well represent the identity, now we measurethe subject similarity between two videos as the max correlation among allpossible pairs in the two bags of features. On the official 5,000 video-pairsof the YouTube Face dataset for face verification, our algorithm achieves acomparable performance with VGG-face that averages over deep features of allframes.

Baseon well-understood intuitive linear models such as Sparse Representation basedClassification (SRC), previous attempts require a prepossessing of explicitdecoupling which is practically inexact. Instead, we exploit the low-rankproperty across frames to subtract the underlying neutral faces which aremodeled jointly with sparse representation on the action components with groupsparsity enforced. On the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset (CK+), our one-shotautomatic method on raw face videos performs as competitive as SRC applied onmanually prepared action components and performs even better than SRC in termsof true positive rate.

We have direct control over the learning rate and batch size, whilethe variance is determined by the choice of model architecture, modelparameterization and dataset. In the equilibrium distribution only the ratio oflearning rate to batch size appears, implying that the equilibrium distributionis invariant under a simultaneous rescaling of learning rate and batch size bythe same amount. We then explore experimentally how learning rate and batchsize affect SGD from two perspectives: the endpoint of SGD and the dynamicsthat lead up to it. For the endpoint, the experiments suggest the endpoint ofSGD is invariant under simultaneous rescaling of batch size and learning rate,and also that a higher ratio leads to flatter minima, both findings areconsistent with our theoretical analysis. We note experimentally that thedynamics also seem to be invariant under the same rescaling of learning rateand batch size, which we explore showing that one can exchange batch size andlearning rate for cyclical learning rate schedule. Next, we illustrate hownoise affects memorization, showing that high noise levels lead to bettergeneralization.

The development of an anti-malware system thatcan counteract an unknown malware is a prolific activity that may benefitseveral sectors. We envision an intelligent anti-malware system that utilizesthe power of deep learning (DL) models. Using such models would enable thedetection of newly-released malware through mathematical generalization. Thatis, finding the relationship between a given malware $x$ and its correspondingmalware family $y$, $f: x \mapsto y$. To accomplish this feat, we used theMalimg dataset (Nataraj et al., 2011) which consists of malware images thatwere processed from malware binaries, and then we trained the following DLmodels 1 to classify each malware family: CNN-SVM (Tang, 2013), GRU-SVM(Agarap, 2017), and MLP-SVM.

On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches theguarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained byusing classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate ofconvergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms.  On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classificationdatasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests.

A sound theoretical understanding of dropout is needed todetermine when dropout should be applied and how to use it most effectively. Inthis paper we continue the exploration of dropout as a regularizer pioneered byWager, et.al. We focus on linear classification where a convex proxy to themisclassification loss (i.e. the logistic loss used in logistic regression) isminimized. We show: (a) when the dropout-regularized criterion has a uniqueminimizer, (b) when the dropout-regularization penalty goes to infinity withthe weights, and when it remains bounded, (c) that the dropout regularizationcan be non-monotonic as individual weights increase from 0, and (d) that thedropout regularization penalty may not be convex. This last point isparticularly surprising because the combination of dropout regularization withany convex loss proxy is always a convex function.  In order to contrast dropout regularization with $L_2$ regularization, weformalize the notion of when different sources are more compatible withdifferent regularizers. We then exhibit distributions that are provably morecompatible with dropout regularization than $L_2$ regularization, and viceversa. These sources provide additional insight into how the inductive biasesof dropout and $L_2$ regularization differ.

This provides a counterpoint to thesuggestion that dropout discourages co-adaptation of weights. We also show thatthe dropout penalty can grow exponentially in the depth of the network whilethe weight-decay penalty remains essentially linear, and that dropout isinsensitive to various re-scalings of the input features, outputs, and networkweights. This last insensitivity implies that there are no isolated localminima of the dropout training criterion.

We provide an analytical description of these phenomena by findingnew exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of deep learning. Our theoreticalanalysis also reveals the surprising finding that as the depth of a networkapproaches infinity, learning speed can nevertheless remain finite: for aspecial class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incuronly a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallownetworks. We show that, under certain conditions on the training data,unsupervised pretraining can find this special class of initial conditions,while scaled random Gaussian initializations cannot.

We find that there are two ingredientsnecessary for building a high-performing neural QA system: first, the awarenessof question words while processing the context and second, a compositionfunction that goes beyond simple bag-of-words modeling, such as recurrentneural networks. Our results show that FastQA, a system that meets these tworequirements, can achieve very competitive performance compared with existingmodels.

Neural network models outperform traditionalapproaches in domains where large datasets exist, such as SQuAD (ca. 100,000questions) for Wikipedia articles.
