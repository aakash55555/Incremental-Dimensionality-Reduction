"The product is excellent, but the pricing is very high in comparison to the grocery store.  (I rarely go to the store, so it was convenient, but it's unlikely that I'll buy this product on line again due to the high cost). ",0,chips
"Great to send to our Marines in Afghanistan. Great size to pack, do not crumble while in transit. Marines love them ",0,chips
They arrived on time and in good shape. Here in Afghanistan we don't get Chipss so they were a real treat ,0,chips
"Pringles are great.  The packs are very small, making the packages handy bit no eco-friendly.  Chipss are arrived largely in tact, but expect some crushed Chipss in each little pack. ",0,chips
"We ordered these pringles because we were missing potato Chipss from the U.S. These Pringles made it to Brazil with not a lot o f crumble bits.  I'm very happy with the speedy delivery, flavor, and these Chipss will be long gone before their expiration date is even thought of (October 2010). Thank you Amazon, we will be ordering more Pringles. ",0,chips
"Yah, got my Pringles and 19 out of the 36 packages were smashed with a broken air seal.  The outer and inner boxes were undamaged. ",0,chips
"You can get the exact same thing in a 24 size at walmart.com for 5.47. Just get 3 of those instead and save yourself 15 bucks. Oh, and they let you choose flavors if you do some searching. ",0,chips

I was disappointed that the Chipss were pretty crumbled.  Must be too much mishandling in the shipping process.  Will not buy these again. ,0,chips
The Chipss were broken up in the cups. So never ate a whole Chips. Very salty. I will not buy again. ,0,chips
Good deal. Way cheaper than byung them in the smaller packs at the store. And you get single servings so I don't eat the whole can. ,0,chips
well we love pringles but I was kind of mistaken thinking they wouldn't be smashed to pieces. Still liked the crumbs. ,0,chips
"Yes, it's very bad for us, however, it's such a great little snack for special occasions.  I bought a case of these for the twins' birthday party, and they were a huge hit with kids and adults!  They will now be a kid party stable at our house. ",0,chips
The potato Chipss arrived and were fresh when opened. Unfortunately every package had more broken Chipss than whole.  Several packages only had 2 Chipss that weren't broken. ,0,chips

These were really good so I had to purchase them again. Great product and I'm glad I did. Good choice. ,0,chips
These are always good tasting but I especially like getting them in the snack sizes because it keeps me from eating too many of them at once. The problem with getting them shipped is that most of the Chipss came broken into pieces. ,0,chips

Wonderful little containers of yummy snacks are a fun way to say hello to your kid in camp.  The case size has enough to share with the entire bunk. ,0,chips
Pringles and a long car ride just go together like two peas in a pod. The only thing is about the variety pack that was the a problem is that I should have bought two packs instead of just one. ,0,chips
"We loved these Chipss.  The thing that upset me was this was on the bottom of the package with no protection.  The airbags near it were flat.  The whole row and over half the other the Chipss were busted up.  Amazon corrected the situation.  The Chipss we were able to eat were fresh and tasty,. ",0,chips
Love the fact that you can snack on smaller portions and don't have to open large containers.  Great for kids lunch boxes. ,0,chips

I have also bought  Betty Crocker  variety pack fruit .The price is very reasonable and it's nice to have free shipping with Amazon.

My nieces love the individual containers and so do I.  Less waste and they can take them with them without a mess. ,0,chips
All 4 of these food products were ordered at the same time and we were very happy with all of them.  This has the added advantage of taking up much less room in the pantry than the individual bags of Chipss. ,0,chips

yeah I was very skeptical when I first purchased these potato Chipss however when I ate the can AFTER I washed my hands yesterday but anywas theskG OGOOD $%3-= ,0,chips
These are Great. If you don't want to give the kids to much. Just give them one or two Snack Stacks Packs and send them on their way. You won't have to worry about them eating to much because you control how much they will be getting. ,0,chips
"The Chipss are great, & the size is perfect for my work lunches. The price here is a little steep. I get mine at either wal mart or meijers. I can pick whatever flavors I like also. ",0,chips
"Love potato Chipss but I can't stand the fact that they can go stale so fast once they've been open.  I used to have packages on top of the refrigerator with 2 handfuls of Chipss in them even though they had been resealed, clipped and re-clipped.  We had seen the 6 pack of regular Pringles in the store and started purchasing them.  Couldn't find the assorted flavors until I went to Amazon (in this day and age of gas prices, I go there quite often rather than drive around to many stores).  Love the assorted packs, Thank you Amazon. ",0,chips
I love buying all snacks size packs.  After schools kids are hungry and these are easy for them to grab and not fill up on.  The price is just as good as the warehouse prices. ,0,chips
"I always loved Pringles, but I could finish a can in a very short time. When I saw these individualized packs, I was excited. Even better was that they came in a variety pack. There are regular, cheddar cheese, and sour cream and onion. My friend was so pleased with the product that he wanted a package for himself. I am on my second box and I am thrilled! They come 36 in a box so they last a good long time. I highly recommend them. ",0,chips
To me this is an excellent value........I am a piggy when it comes to Chipss and packaged in the individual packs is perfect.  Makes one stop & think before devouring the whole carton.  One pack or two at a time.....perfect. ,0,chips
i am a big fan of these ... you can find them cheap and as long as you eat them within 3 or 4 days they are moist and chewy.  normally i buy my bagels from a bagel store but if you're short on funds or want yummy snacks aorund the house to feed your friends these are a good call.  also good with cream cheese of course. ,1,bagel
"I like to review books and an occasional dvd -----I have never reviewed a food product.  But.............after tasting an ""Everything Bagel"" a few days ago, I am compelled to rave about it somewhere.  It was REALLY great  --  ate half with cream cheese and half with butter.  The taste is a wonderful and delicious mix of very chewable seeds along with a crispy outer and soft inner roll.<br /><br />This was a fortunate find because sometimes breakfast can be a little boring with just toast or a muffin.  These bagels are so good, I find myself thinking about them occasionally during odd hours.  Yes, they are that good. ",1,bagel
Tasted like a couple of pieces of toast.  Anyone who likes bagels should stay away from these. ,1,bagel
These took awhile to get here but they were still good and tasted fine. Considering the price though I am not sure I would order these again since I can get them a lot cheaper in the stores. ,1,bagel
"I normally do not like the high protein breads, but this was really good!  The texture was not rubbery and is packed full of protein that kept me full for hours! ",1,bagel
Wanted a high protein breakfast food and this is it.  A little bit chewy but it doesn't change the taste.  Best tasting bagel when looking for high protein food. ,1,bagel
"I ordered these kosher bagels twice in the past month.  The first time they came within 2 days or so, and they still had that fresh bagel aroma.  They are not quite as chewy or big as the ones my Bubbe used to get in Queens, but still good.  The second time, there was a delay of about 2 days before shipping, plus 2-3 days to get to us in Tennessee.  Although they weren't stale, the flavor naturally wasn't quite as good. The bakery, Davidovich of New York, included a 7th bagel for free.  (Maybe as compensation? Anyway, thank you!)  Their enclosed card marks a location on a map in midtown Manhattan, but the package was shipped from Woodside, Queens.<br />The bagels are good enough that I may try them again.  It would be nice if they would offer some varieties other than Plain.  How about Poppy Seed, Onion, Egg, Sesame, or ""Everything""?<br />Also, I urge the seller to provide better packaging for shipment around the country, perhaps a vacuum seal, since the shipping method is UPS Ground.<br />FLASH (11/5/09): The seller has now more than doubled the price of the 6 bagels, from $4.50 to $9.50, PLUS it's still $5.49 shipping -- way too expensive, in my opinion!  Maybe they intended to provide FREE shipping, which would be a $.50 reduction vs. the previous total? ",1,bagel
"Yes, that is correct. This type of bagel sold through Amazon,  you could get in the local supermarkets in Queens, NY. , for about $5.00 a dozen. There ok , but not as good as the one's made in the bagel shops. Those made in and for the bagel shops were very special and cost around $10.00 a dozen. ",1,bagel
"Do not order these bagels the texture is like a hamburger bun and the taste is not like a true bagel, ",1,bagel
"These are not bagels. If you want Parker House Rolls then buy these. If you want real bagels, don't waste your money. We gave ours away they were so bad we could not eat them.  If there was a half star rating I would give that rating. ",1,bagel
"Time - Was suppose to arrived in a few days but arrievd next day.<br /><br /> Taste - Absolutely delicious, worth to buy, and most of all stays very fresh.<br /><br />Packed - Was well packed and easy to serve.<br /><br />Bottom Line - If you're looking for fresh bagels and a easy way to get it to you house, this is your answer!<br /><br />Enjoy! ",1,bagel
I was very disappointed in these what you are calling bagels. .  They are NOT bagels and I will never order them again. ,1,bagel
"Perfect Bagels, nice size, great texture. Put them in the freezer to keep them fresh longer, or pop one in the toaster for a quick fix treat. ",1,bagel
WOW!  This one is truly a NY bagel.  It is the best tasting bagel I have ever tried.  Excellent with cream cheese and lox! ,1,bagel
These come up in a search for low carb items but yet there is no nutritional data I could find anywhere.  I am not taking the chance. ,1,bagel
"I have been eating bagles all of my life and these are the worst. they look like big rolls and taste like heavy bread.  i ate one with lox and cream chese and it sat in my tummy like a ball of lead for 2 days.  I tried to give them to my neighbors with no luck after they tasted them and made a sick face and spit it out. the worst part is very funny to other people because I ordered 8 dozen for over $80.00.  I have been buying from Amazon for years and have never sent anything back, and this is the 1st review I have written about products that I got from Amazon . I did not return them because by the time they would have received them they would have been stale and god knows what the shipping would have coat Amazon. If you buy them go fishing and you can use them a sinkers.<br />amazon.Well it pay to learn, that what my pappy used to say.  these were not purchased from Amazon. The shipper was LILLYS HOME STYLE OUT OF NEW YORK.  i WENT TO WALL MART AND GOT SOME GOOD LADNERS BAGLES SO I COULD EAT MY LOX. GOOD BUY  TWIGGY ",1,bagel
"MM's Review:  I enjoy these bagels as one of the most delicious -ly important source of protein in my daily meal plan.  If possible, I like to have at least 2 to 3 servings per day.  These plain bagels are low in sodium, fat without adding any toppings and not too bad for the gluten- intolerant person.  One of the blueberry bagel is sweet enough by itself for a natural carbohydrate treat!  There are nutritional and life sustaining value when one has a consumable meal or snack of this yummy and worthy bread for life to satisfy one's hunger.  Thank you to the baker's of these tasty bagel's. ",1,bagel
Thomas' makes incredible English Muffins.  The people who designed their bagels have never had bagels.  Thomas' Bagels are Bagel shaped bread.  There is nothing bagel about it. ,1,bagel
"I really liked the light sugar taste. not overly sugary, but a yummy cinnamon flavor and a very nice treat! taste like normal bagel chips except that they are gluten- free. Glutino does a great job here. ",1,bagel
"These are very tasty, not too sweet, and very crunchy.  I have to hide them from the kids because they love them but they don't need to eat gluten free like me. ",1,bagel
"All the bagels were broken, small pieces like somebody dropped them or stepped over the box. Not sure if it was from the shipping or from the manufacture but don't waste your money ordering it ",1,bagel
Great snack any time of the day. Good flavor and not too hard. Easy to carry anywhere. Even my granddaughter likes to eat them ,1,bagel
"Delicious and came in relatively whole state. Maybe a broken one here and there, but since they are cinnamon and sugar bagel chips it does not matter. ",1,bagel
"These are basically bagel chips that have the tiniest hint of cinnamon and sugar. If you look at the chips themselves you won't even see cinnamon and sugar on the coating. If you think the flavor is in the chip itself, wrong again. I won't be purchasing these again. What a let down Glutino. ",1,bagel
"The coating falls off or it just wasn't on there enough in the first place. I wanted to be able to have the same kind of experience as snacking on cinnamon and sugar cereal, but this just has a hint of sweet and cinnamon. If I put it into dip, the flavor has to come from the dip and then why bother. I won't waste my money again. ",1,bagel
"The product is definitely better than average.  Unfortunately after the product is shipped too much of the crackers is but crumbs.  I actually called to complain to the shipping company who very graciously sent out replacements.  I had hoped that the new batch would be more intact.  It was perhaps marginally better.  Glutino should work on the packaging as so much of their product is excellent, especially their rosemary and olive oil crackers. ",1,bagel
"These chips taste even better than non-gluten free bagel chips.  I couldn't believe I went through a box in no time at all (Scary!).  Unfortunately, Amazon's price of this writing, six bucks a box, is beyond crazy!  The boxes aren't very big to begin with!  I paid about four bucks at my local grocery store, and I've seen them on sale for less than three, so shop around! ",1,bagel
"I was noticing that our stores weren't always offering the plain gluten free bagel chips without dairy. I love eating these as a snack, but it is fantastic to have real croutons on my salad again. Thank goodness I can still find them at Amazon. ",1,bagel
"Even now a days it can be difficult to find gluten free products in the local grocery stores routinely. Amazon comes through again. These are great for snacking, putting on salads. We use them in place of bread crumbs, a big hit. ",1,bagel
The flavor & texture is just like wheat bagel chips but too many are broken in the box to make me want to buy them other than for special occasions 8( ,1,bagel
"they must not be completely DF, tho, cos something in there doesn't work for me... sooo sad to give them up, cos they have a Huge Crunch, great taste, just love 'em. ",1,bagel
"Picked up a box of these and we made Chex mix with GF pretzel sticks, peanuts, rice & corn chex equal to the amount of all 3 types in the normal recipe and used LEa & Perrins worchestshire sauce which is also GF. So good my 2 yr old is trying to eat it all. Another snack food reclaimed! ",1,bagel
"The crunchy texture is great. My son discovered my Parmesan garlic stash at home. When he heard he couldn't because it contains casein (cow's milk protein) he was very insistent. So I checked and found these. He's such a happy camper. If you have the type of person in your life living the GF CF diet, these are great in flavor and texture. Also glad I read that the package has improved so that there aren't so many crumbs. ",1,bagel
THESE ARE THE BEST GLUTEN FREE CRACKER/BAGEL/CHIPS EVER. THEY TASTE FANTASTIC AND YOU CAN NOT TELL THAT THEY ARE GLUTEN FREE BY THE TASTE OR TEXTURE. ,1,bagel
"I never liked gluten free bread, but I am in love with these bagel chips. They are quite small, but very tasty. For those of us who went gluten free but miss the taste of bread-based snacks - this one is great! Not just OK, but great. But beware: they are addictive :-_ ",1,bagel
But the first pg I opened was mostly crumbs. I picked out the few whole chips and will use the crumbs for soup or toppings. They taste good but I hope the other 5 pgs are more chips and less crumbs. ,1,bagel
"I've been totally Gluten Free for over five years so I'm always looking for yummy Gluten Free goodies. The Glutino Gluten Free Bagel Chips are nice and crunchy but VERY SALTY. Way too much salt for me. I'm going to buy some of my favorite Gluten Free bagels and make some bagel chips myself, probably garlic flavored, without all of that salt! ",1,bagel
Really great taste!  Sometimes though pkg has more crumbs than crackers and when your paying the price we pay for gluten free items I want crackers not crumbs.  It's happened to me with enough pkgs that I have to comment. ,1,bagel
"My husband has been gluten free for several years. He likes the Glutino crackers, too, but these are his favorites. ",1,bagel
"While most GF crackers have either a weird texture or lack flavor, these bagel chips are close to the real thing. Only problem is breakage, but the new sturdier box is an improvement. ",1,bagel
"I usually purchase these at our neighborhood Walmart, but I wanted a decent supply for a dinner party.  I served these with hummus, and everyone loved them whether they eat GF or not!  These are great for snacks as well! ",1,bagel
I love these with soups and salads.  Even just plain with cheese on them the are just great yo eat. ,1,bagel
"I have been eating these for the past year, since I became Gluten<br />intollerant.  They are wonderful !!  Unlike the Gluten free Bagels and<br />breads, they are REALLY, REALLY GOOD !!!!The only thing I don't<br />like is that there are too many broken pieces that are good for eating<br />out of the box but not for serving or spreading. ",1,bagel
I love the chips.....it is refreshing to get tasty gluten free products especially at the high prices GF products demand. ,1,bagel
"These are the closest thing to ""real"" food I can find gluten-free so far. They taste just like regular bagel chips and are versitile.  I use them in place of chips and crackers.  Only problem I have is my local grocery does not restock them often, so I'm left ordering in bulk.  Online sites all seems to run close to Amazon's price, though here it's a dollar or so cheaper.  The grocery store is less, but they are tough for me to get. ",1,bagel
"I am so happpppppy. I hope you have time to read this.<br />I was born in Amityville NY and can remember as a child NY bagels. I always was so glad on Saturday mornings as my Father would take me to get them. When I was 18 moved as I married an army man. We have traveled the country for 27 years and this past year finally came back to NY. We are stationed at FT. Drum. Watertown , NY. I was so happy to get back to NY for bagels. Now here's where you come in.<br /><br />I have tried bagels from Watertown, Syracuse , even went to Vermont in search of the perfect bagel. So disappointed for you've not had a bagel till you've had a NY one or so I thought. I was so disappointed in my search about to give up when I am a Amazon shopper. I found you there and said oh what the heck lets try. Thank God for your bagels I am so happy to have found real NY bagels. I will be ordering again soon as they are well worth it. You have made me very happy as they are delicious.<br /><br />Thanks again, ",1,bagel
There is nothing better than a real east coast bagel and these are that!  I discovered Goldberg Bagels when I recently visited Baltimore and I am so excited I can now have them delivered to Seattle.  Yummers... ,1,bagel
"I've ordered Goldbergs bagels for daughters on the west coast.....far, far from &#34;real&#34; bagels.  They're big and fresh and a real treat.  I ordered some for myself not believing the west coast reports, and found them to be really, really great bagels.  Love the Black Russian!  I feel, even with the shipping, that the cost is well worth it for the bagel fix everyone needs now and then, when living far from the possibility of getting the real deal....these bagels are the real deal!

"Born & raised on real NY/NJ Jewish bagels for Sunday mornings&#8230;My favorite shop was on Elmora Ave Elizabeth, NJ, was closed on Saturdays for Shabbat! I continued that tradition with my daughter who moved to TX three years ago. I ordered these on Sunday to send to my daughter in Waco, TX. She'd been bugging me for a week or so and hunting NY Bagels on the internet yielded several highly rated bagel shops that ship. All were cost prohibitive due to shipping charges, not the bagels themselves. Well, you never know from a picture or user reviews (often they are written by paid reviewers who&#8217;ve never sampled the product). Well, the bagels arrived yesterday and she was thrilled. &#8220;They smell amazing&#8221;! was her first reaction&#8230;second text was, &#8220;Luke is cream cheesin my second one now. So F&#8217;n good!&#8221;&#8230;her only complaint was that she wished they were bigger. When pressed on bigger she clarified that as taller. Needless to say, the next time she gets a hankerin she&#8217;ll be ordering them herself. ",1,bagel
"I have had these bagels and can say they are the best I've had in years. They tasted freshly baked (the shipping was fast), and took me back to memories of warm bagels with a smear from years ago. I had an assortment and my taste buds can attest they are all delicious. The only drawback is the cost of shipping...sigh...which is the reason for the 4 not 5 stars. (These are large bagels, not the puny little ones often found in major grocery stores.) ",1,bagel
Really moist and delicious and convenient--a simply great and easy way to start you day and kids will love them too!,2,muffin
The flavors are the best. The two pack is easy to eat from. Not that boring at all to look at.,2,muffin
Just wish there was more banana nut muffins - they are the best of the bunch. Will probably order again,2,muffin
"These muffins were very moist and stayed that way until opened. After several weeks, they were still moist and fresh. They are a little small, but there are two in a package. The only problem is that they tend to stick to the paper cups a little, but this is not enough of a problem to keep me from buying more.",2,muffin
These muffins were very fresh and arrived on time as all of my Amazon purchases do. They were extremely moist and quite delicious. I was so glad to find them online since I've only seen them at Sam's Club. I only wish there were more banana nut muffins as opposed to blueberries.,2,muffin
"These are my favorite muffins now. They are so moist and good, I just got hooked on them right away.If you love muffins. You will love these.",2,muffin
Extremely Good and very Mouth Watering to the actual taste. Also tectured Very Nicely To the Touch and Feel,2,muffin
Love the Otis Spunkmeyer Muffins! You can actually freeze them if you don't eat them right away and when unfrozen they are still just as fresh and taste just as good,2,muffin
"Funny after taste...not impressed at all. Besides, the price here was 3x more expensive than the price at other physical stores.",2,muffin
"Absolutely delectable! I don't need them, but I think I can treat myself from time to time. And, I will. :-)",2,muffin
They weren't bad but some got crushed in the mail nobody wants pancake muffins but ya wouldn't do it again,2,muffin
"Most of the chocolate ones I received had mold on them, which made me not really want to eat the others. Disappointed with purchase. The brand is good - but I would play it safe and get them fromt he grocery store instead.",2,muffin
Quick and tasty! Item arrived fast and fresh. Would order again! Love the variety pack. Sent to college with daughter.,2,muffin
Delicious the best muffins ever will highly recommend them and buy them again. My kids love them there favorite is the chocolate one my favorite is the blueberry.,2,muffin
"A little pricey, but very delicious and worth that price! I love having the Banana Nut in the morning before I go to work its the best!",2,muffin
they arrived on time they were fresh its just all good know problems will order again and again i loved them going to order soon.,2,muffin
"I have been using this product for about 3 years now. When I was on Weight Watchers I would use no-fat egg substitute instead of eggs and apple sauce instead of oil, and each muffin would only be 2 points. And They.Are.Yummy. Now that I'm off WW, I still make them the same way because they taste just as good, and who needs the extra fat. I also like them because of the fiber and that's all I'll say about that. I used to get them at a warehouse store (3 packs), but that store stopped selling them. They are not cheap in the regular grocery store, so a friend recommended I see if they sell them through Amazon's subscription service and they did! Still not as cheap as they used to be at the warehouse store, BUT with the free shipping, they are much cheaper than going out the store and buying them. I eat two muffins a day, every day. LOVE them.",2,muffin
"These muffins are awesome!! I thought that they would be just okay which I would have been fine with since I need healthy snacks but they blew me away. The taste is amazing (better than any other mix I have ever made). I did use applesauce instead of oil and used egg whites instead of whole eggs. I only baked them until toothpick came out clean *for me that was 15 minutes. The tops weren't brown at the point but that is okay since I like to reheat muffins in the toaster oven which browns them up nicely. I personally do not like huge blueberries in my muffins so I was happy to see that they are little pieces. I am going to do subscribe & save now since I know I will be eating a LOT of these yummy treats. The banana ones are okay but you can definitely taste the ""healthy"" aspect to them. The blueberry ones do not have that healthy taste :)",2,muffin
"Fiber One also makes a pre-made, frozen version of these that Sam's Club carried on a limited run. After becoming addicted to these I searched high and low and found this mix on Amazon. They are terrific! High in fiber and low fat while still moist and delicious :) Just make sure not to eat the whole box at once...like I'm apt to do if I make the whole batch!",2,muffin
These taste as good as they are for you. My children actually love these and they can be quite picky eaters.,2,muffin
"These are yummy and delicious. The secret to making them the best is to add your own blueberries. You then get a delicious muffin that is easy to make with the taste of blueberries and high in fiber, low in fat. I checked the nutritional labeling on the package and do not see any transfat, so the reviewer that said that is not correct.",2,muffin
"Found this product when I started Weight Watchers program. They are low fat, high fiber, and very tasty. I am now at my goal but continue to eat them just because they are delicious and help me to stay at my goal.",2,muffin
My family uses Amazon's fabulous Subscribe & Save program. We alternate buying the Fiber One Blueberry Muffin Mix and the Fiber One Banana Nut Muffin Mix monthly. The muffins are delicious!,2,muffin
"What is there to say, it's muffin mix. For some reason unable to find in local stores anymore, glad to find it on Amazon. I use the low cholesterol instructions on side of box, they always come out good.",2,muffin
"to start each day is with two fresh, delicious Blueberry muffins and a hot cup of 1/2 and 1/2 coffee!",2,muffin
We have been baking and eating these muffins for quite some time and really like them. We freeze some and they are available as needed.,2,muffin
"I'm totally impressed. Great flavor, not gritty. I used the low fat directions, unsweetened applesauce and egg whites. Most excellant",2,muffin
"These were really good as packaged, but when I added some extra Maine Blueberries they were great! Use paper muffin cups for the best results.",2,muffin
"Who doesn't like muffins? Who doesn't like moist, tasty blueberry muffins that are easy to make? No one, ever. Ask about fiber and you will get a blank stare. Just don't ask. Make these and your family will add fiber to their diets willingly. And ask for more.",2,muffin
"I was buying this at the local store and they no longer carry it. Good stuff. Tasty and lots of fiber (ok, I'm old. I need a lot of fiber!) lol",2,muffin
Best muffin mix on the market in my opinion. Plus the added benefit of fiber. Easy prep and great taste. How much better could it be???,2,muffin
My husband used to stop at Dunkin Donuts for a muffin in the morning. He really likes these so now I make them for him so he can grab one on the way out the door. He also takes them to work to share with his work colleagues.,2,muffin
I absolutely love these...low fat high fiber. I do add a handful of blueberries as it is difficulte to get an authentic blueberry muffin taste from a box. But it's no bother they are just that good...YUM!,2,muffin
"My main requirement for blueberry muffins is real blueberries. But there's none to be found in this mix! I don't want anything artificial in something I cook, thank you. It's fine to have fake blueberries in something already-prepared, but if I actually have to get out bowls and muffin pans to cook, I need real ingredients and nutrition to justify my time!!",2,muffin
"I didn't check the calories, the ingredients, or any other wasteful measurement. My checklist included: Is it muffin mix? CHECK. Easy to make? CHECK. Taste delicious? CHECK, CHECK, mmmCHECK. Say they have something healthy on the box? CHECK. Boom, man food checklist done. Also, could have been a mistake, but I originally thought I ordered a 6-pack, but the receipt and packing list said 4-pack...but I got 6 boxes. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat? AWESOME!!",2,muffin
"Based on the high ratings, I thought I would give these a shot. Wow! Who knew blue SweetTarts were passing for ""dried blueberries"" these days. And what's with the partially hydroginated oil? Come on, Betty Crocker. True, they don't taste horrible. But since it takes only 5 minutes to whip up a batter for real, high-fiber muffins (with no trans fats!) this product seems a waste of time.",2,muffin
"No blueberries to be found, they use blueberry concentrate to create a skittle like nodule. Not any blueberry flavor.",2,muffin
"These are the BEST blueberry muffins (mix) I've come across so far. I really like that they are much lower in calories than other muffins, and the blueberries are actually good (I hate blueberries).",2,muffin
these are the best muffin mix I've found. My kids adore them (I make mini muffins) and they're actually pretty decent in terms of ingredients (not a lot of preservatives or unhealthy junk).,2,muffin
"Not only are these quick and easy to make, but they are delicious! They taste like donuts or something. I still can't believe they're fat free. Great for breakfast.",2,muffin
These taste like regular blueberry muffins and do not taste fat free at all. My husband & I love them.,2,muffin
A favorite Amazon purchase. Make these all the time. I like to add two tablespoons of flax seed and 2 tsp. of grated lemon rind which i crumble by hand into a tablespoon ( more or less to taste depending on the amount of rind used) of sugar. I also add the drained blueberries to the dry mix before adding the water. The less stirring after the water is added the more tender the muffin.,2,muffin
"Makes great muffins, alas a bit on the sweet side. Super easy and fast to prepare, just mix it all up and bake. Will buy again.",2,muffin
I have to watch my fat intake but I like baked goods. This is the perfect answer. It is good quality and good taste and very easy to make.,2,muffin
These were a perfect treat for my daughter whose medical condition requires extreme low fat. I was surprised that they tasted so good!,2,muffin
"Tasty and simple, everyone loves a bite, so I highly recommend. Quick and easy and makes the house or office smell great. This price including shipping beats all local markets. Try other flavors, especially the cinnamon. I will buy again. I hope this helps someone.",2,muffin
"I have been so pleased with my Simple Mills purchase!! Every single member of my family of 4 , ranging from 10-35 yrs old and from picky to pickier, loved these muffins! Great job, Simple Mills, we will be back!",2,muffin
So great to find a gluten free product that is low glycemic! These mixes make eating gluten free healthy and easy. Bonus- the kids love them too!,2,muffin

I needed some more oatmeal for breakfast and this hit the spot. I myself need more than just one packet and will typically use a plain and another flavor to use up the plain oatmeal. I don't know anyone that wants to eat plain oatmeal but that is my solution for the packs rather than throwing them away. Several people complain of the price but not having to deal with going to the store for it and the taxes of it more than makes up for any differences.,3,oatmeal
"When I ordered this product there were many more flavors listed such as ""cinnamon roll"" & ""banana bread""....so this is why I ordered. When it came in the mail it only had 4 flavors. Cinnamon & Spice, Apples/Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, & original. I won't be purchasing this again on Amazon.",3,oatmeal
"What is pictured and what you recieve is not the same! The picture when I ordered had 6 or 7 different flavors pictured, one being banana, which is the main reason I ordered and I recieved only original flavors. I will not recommend this seller and will never order from them again!",3,oatmeal

"I can summarize the new recipe version in one word -- disgusting! The new formula for the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor tasted like oatmeal mixed with cheap, off-brand frosting or marshmellow flavoring. I had originally thought mine was just bad in some way, but then I confirmed the product image clearly showed on the box ""Classic Recipe"" (upper left corner of box), but that is not what Hutshop gave Amazon to distribute.

"you really don't need to add sweetener. HNCs are, IMO, superior to corn flakes due to their ability to last soaking in milk in a crunchy state before they get soggy. I particularly like to mix them in a bowl w/ 1 or 2 other kinds of serial, for that reason and their built-in 'sweet state.' Their only noticeable lack is that they do not carry a high fiber content w/ them, kind of a filler food which I wish added just a touch more, than they take up inside of you. ",5,coldcereal
My husband eats cereal every morning. He loves Cheerios since they have a good flavor and he does not need to add sugar. The packaging was great and the price is better than anything we can get locally. ,5,coldcereal
deal and great cereal.  one of the best!  I got these on subscribe and save and it was a good deal. ,5,coldcereal
How to improve  on an already good product?  Just look at Honey Nut Cheerios and you'll see how it's done.  I was a devoted &#34;plain&#34; Cheerios consumer and one day decided just to try the Honey Nut variety out of curiosity.  Now it's the first choice for me if I don't want to have hot oatmeal. I have cereal -- hot or cold -- for breakfast most mornings  and I really enjoy starting my day with Honey Nut Cheerios.  Heart healthy and tasty -- can't ask for more from a breakfast cereal can you? ,5,coldcereal
This was great value for a great item. My son loves this product and this offer was too good to miss ,5,coldcereal
Got the subscription as a lark so my granddaughter gets a box of four of her favorite cereal each month. ,5,coldcereal
"Honey nut Cheerios to your doorstep, what could be better.  The arrived fresh and ready to enjoy for a great breakfast. ",5,coldcereal
My granddaughter and little cousin likes this cereal. It is great evening snack. I send them boxed home. Great price. ,5,coldcereal
I love having the option to subscribe and save. I never run out and the price is so much cheaper than where I normally buy my groceries. Total win-win! ,5,coldcereal
"I love cereal and it's my go to snack many days.  As a kid, I dumped tablespoons of sugar on my cereal but quit years ago...this cereal is good as is. ",5,coldcereal
Honey Nut Cheerios are a routine breakfast option in our household. We think the taste and nutritional value are great. The subscribe and save beats our local grocery store. Shipping speed and packaging were great. ,5,coldcereal
We have been eating this cereal for quite some time and when I noticed it on Amazon I thought I might get a great deal. Had to pass up ordering as the price at the local grocery stores is less. Sorry Amazon---this is one of the few items I have not immediately ordered from Amazon when our supply was diminished.This is a very good cereal product and we love it. ,5,coldcereal
"These are Honey Nut Cheerios and if you like these, then you like them.  If you don't then you don't.  So why would you order these?  Well... they come packaged as four individually packaged boxes.  Okay, so that is the best I can come up with other than the price here was really good. ",5,coldcereal
"Really love the honey flavor, got the 4 pack so hope they last for more than 2-3 weeks, as these go fast around here ",5,coldcereal
my kids love this stuff and i can't see to make it last longer than 1 month; they have it for breakfast when we are in a hurry; they have it for snacks; ,5,coldcereal
"Taste great and fresh , straight from the factory it seems , right out the box ready to go yummy good stuff !! ",5,coldcereal
We love being able to get this in the Amazon subscribe and save.  Goes very well with fruit and almond milk. ,5,coldcereal
Who doesn't love hone nut Cheerios? They are a staple in our house. We love the subscribe and see discount as well. ,5,coldcereal
"This was one of my favorites growing up.  The boxes, however, are much too small.  It gives about 4 servings.  Wish they offered larger sizes. ",5,coldcereal
My kids love Honey Nut Cheerios and we go through several boxes a week. This was a great deal for us since Amazon had a coupon on it. ,5,coldcereal
I enjoyed eating cereal. Healthy food choice for morning and the flavor is good as well. Will buy again. Thanks! ,5,coldcereal
My entire family loves this flavor.  The price is comparable to my local grocery store when bought on a Subscribe and Save plan. ,5,coldcereal
"I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not! ",6,cerealbar
"The illusion of nutrition... The ingredients aren't all that wholesome (high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup are the first two ingredients), but these Nutrigrain bars are popular in the office.  3 grams of fat and 130 calories in a bar. ",6,cerealbar
Handy little tasty goodness for go-lunches for adults or grab something easy at home with coffee. Boxes arrived in good shape and bars are nicely moist. Expiration date is really good = middle of next year! Thanks Amazon. ,6,cerealbar
"Wow - we just FLEW through a box of these things !! they are great for taking on the road, and you can avoid the junk that usually goes along with the morning coffee... ",6,cerealbar
"Nutri-Grain bars are relatively healthy snack bars that can even serve as a meal replacement if your a light eater or you eat a couple of them. I really like the apple flavor, and so I am disappointed that this box breaks down into 1/3 apple and 2/3 strawberry. It would be nice if they offered a 48 pack of just the apple flavor. I do find that easting more than one of these can be a chore as they are a bit dry, so its best to have some water on hand when you eat them. I use these when I'm hungry enough to start eating something worse for me like a candy bar or other unhealthy food. They're sort of a fill in for sugar based snacks, and for that purpose, they're perfect. I keep some in my car and in my desk. They taste ok; not fantastic, but good enough. These are NOT protein or meal replacement bars, and will NOT fill you up if you eat just one. They're a snack only. If you want something more filling, check out the South Beach Diet Protein Bars. They're a lot more filling. ",6,cerealbar
These are great snacks for after school for our son.  They are also great for traveling.  Multi flavor packaging is great because lil guys like different colors than there friends or siblings. ,6,cerealbar
These are of the same high quality and taste that you would find in your local grocery store. Big advantage is that they are delivered. Don't have to drive and use up expensive gasoline! ,6,cerealbar
I like this mix but I don't like the strawberry ones too much.and you can find this pack at Bjs for cheaper as well. ,6,cerealbar
My sister hasn't been big on healthy things but she told me that she loves them im happy happy happy lol!!! have and blessed day everyone!!! ,6,cerealbar
"Each bar was smaller than I expected. It was also too soft, not crunchy, however it had a good taste. ",6,cerealbar
These disappear quickly in my house. Kids love them and they're pretty low in saturated fat. With how fast we eat them up for snacks it's nice to get a big box at a time. ,6,cerealbar
These are great to keep in my office and this is a good deal that rivals the deals that I sometimes find at Sam's Club. ,6,cerealbar
I love Nutri-Grain and to be able to buy them in bulk is a bonus.  I keep most of the bars at work so when I need that afternoon snack they are their.  I also ocassionally have them for breakfast. ,6,cerealbar
"These bars are edible and taste okay, but I bought them for eating in the office.  With all the crumbs that fall off (even when I eat as carefully as I can), I have to eat them over a plate or trash can, which looks ridiculous. ",6,cerealbar
when i need to reach for a  breakfast bar and being on the go this package  comes in so handy.  its good to switch things up and have different flavors and tastes. however they are all good for the system period.  got these for a  cool deal and its worth it plus they last a long time.  they taste good and are solid as a early  form of breakfast. ,6,cerealbar
Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! Great product! Great product! Great Product! I enjoy it a lot and I'm glad I ordered it. My friend recommended this product to me as well. So I'm glad I ordered it. It's great that's all can I please stop typing now? ,6,cerealbar
I ordered these a few months ago and they were on the free shipping with a $25 or more order. I still have 2 boxes left. Good price and great to have in the house. ,6,cerealbar
"I was surprised when this box came in the mail. I think for the money this is actually a pretty good deal. Three different favors, forty-eight bars. ",6,cerealbar
"Granted these traveled a long ways to get to me, but still they were unusually dry...that could have just been bad luck with that batch. ",6,cerealbar
"The price for these were good.  While I personally do not eat these Nutri-Grain bars they are great vending machine products and my kids enjoys them.  While they do not have a lot of nutritional value, They are still better than candy  bars and chips.  Will purchase these again from Amazon. ",6,cerealbar
"Really delicious and convenient for the working person or for kids--just put them in your lunch box, backpack or purse for a great snack during the day and they are healthy too!!! ",6,cerealbar
"I have bought these for years:  for my mother-in-law in a facility, now for my granddaughter to use in her college dorm.  She doesn't always feel like or have time to go to breakfast and she loves these.  The variety box is especially nice for her. ",6,cerealbar
They arrived on time and was packaged very well. All I can say is Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars really taste great! ,6,cerealbar
"These things are really tasty. Especially the strawberry flavor. They're not exactly a full meal (unless you eat a bunch of them) but they are great snacks for tiding someone over until their next meal. Or if you just need to grab something quick to eat as you're running out the door, these can't be beat. Invest in a box, you'll be glad you did. ",6,cerealbar
Love the taste and the various flavors -- each one is individually wrapped -- nice to carry along just in case u get hungry on the road. ,6,cerealbar
"The bars were a little sweet, but they are really good. For someone who doesn't eat breakfast, these bars did make me feel better about getting something into my stomach at the start of my day. I would definitely purchase them again. ",6,cerealbar
These are healthy and tasty bars that come in a variety of flavors and last quite awhile because the box is so large. ,6,cerealbar
"I like Nutrigrain bars! I've noticed they have gotten a bit smaller over the years. These are fresh, and they arrived in perfect shape. ",6,cerealbar
"the box is too big, much more bigger than i thought. But its too sweet i can not take it. Which leads to it still there after 3 months i brought it. ",6,cerealbar
"Having 3 athletic teens, we're always feeding them and their friends.  Better than chips and candy bars to ward off their munchies and cravings, we subscribe to a frequent delivery of a case of these from Amazon to get an even better price, and keep our closet stocked with bars like this instead of junk foods.  Our kids grab these in the morning on the way too school, keep them tucked in their backbacks for quick nibble-fixes during the day, and if their friends come over after school or if they have team events to go to and have a quick hunger attack.  These are handy and filling, and a great Amazon Prime value. ",6,cerealbar
"These Nutri-Grain Kellogg's Cereal Bars aren't as horrible as you'd expect.  In fact they actually taste pretty good.  No, nothing will ever be able to replicate an actual bowl of cereal on a hungry Monday morning, but when you're late for work and having trouble getting the kids out the door and to the bus stop in time, you can count on a nice healthy cereal bar as a worthwhile alternative.  These are significantly more delicious than pop tarts too.  I never understood the appeal of pop tarts- whether in a toaster or eating cold, they still taste horrendous.  Cereal bars -especially these ones- are much better.  Your tastebuds will thank you... and thank me for the recommendation, haha. ",6,cerealbar
"48 pack is nice, and the variety is great! A good healthy choice for snacks. Since I don't have a Sam's club membership, buying off of amazon was an excellent idea. ",6,cerealbar
I like the taste. It is not that nutritious as one would think as it has high fructose corn syrup but it is still better than eating lots of candy or chips for snack. I keep it in my office and eat it on the days when I forgot to carry a snack. ,6,cerealbar
"Nothing surprising here. The product arrived on time and is what I had expected. Also, it was a good deal. ",6,cerealbar
I love these soft delicious fruit bars in the morning with my tea--this was more economical to buy in bulk--being a prime member I also had no shipping cost... ,6,cerealbar
"I love these bars, especially the apple cinnamon. And buying them in bulk on Amazon.com is a great way to always have them in the house. I don't have to put them on my shopping list anymore. ",6,cerealbar
Brought these for my grandson and he loved them. They received them fast and were freash and not outdated or ready to expire. ,6,cerealbar
"The products came in timely manner, fresh and packaging was in good condition. Which is important to me. ",6,cerealbar
..THEY'RE NOT BAD PER SE. I JUST PREFER THE QUAKER OATS VARIETY PAK FRUIT BARS BETTER 4 ONE SIMPLE REASON. THE CRUST OR COOKIE PORTION OF THESE BARS HAVE A GRITTY GRAINY TEXTURE THAT CRUMBLE + MAKE A MESS. THE QUAKER OATS VARIETY HAVE A TEXTURE MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE SMOOTH OUTER LAYER OF FIG NEWTONS. ITS JUST A PREFERENCE THING ON MY PART. ,6,cerealbar
"when i was a boy growing up in Dirtyjunk, Oklahoma I used to fantasize about fruit filled bars to shove into your mouth hole.  My wet nurse used to beat me with pool noodles and scream ""get away from me. i don't know you. why are you covered in jelly?""  well, today is the day.  a day that will forever be recorded in the epic that is the history of me. kellogg, you came into my life like gypsy buttermilk and never shook my hand, but i forgive you. never look directly into the center of the nutri or it will certainly swallow your soul. ",6,cerealbar
"These are great, my kids love them and so do I! I got them on sale here for about $ 13 with free prime shipping! Great Deal! Also they were fresh and within expiration ",6,cerealbar
I love these things. And I love getting a big box so that I don't have to spend $1 for each one in the vending machine at work. Good stuff. ,6,cerealbar
I loved the delivery response which was quick and my family and I enjoyed them. It was nice not having to run out to the store. ,6,cerealbar
"I was happy to find a variety pack of the Nutri Grain bars.  These make a great quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack when you're in a hurry.  I like the apple cinnamon flavor and the blueberry are pretty good too, but no one seems to be fond of the strawberry ones.  Out of a 48 count box, most of the strawberry ones are still sitting here untouched. ",6,cerealbar
I hope that Kelloggs stops trying to save $.01 cent by using High Fructose instead of sugar and gets out of bed with the US Corn Industry. ,6,cerealbar
"Do not bother buying this product. It is processed food. The definition of unhealthiness, it does not fill you up at all. It makes you feel sick after wards. America does not need to be any fatter than it already is, so please go to the grocery store and buy something healthy for your kids. ",6,cerealbar
"These bars were soft and not too sweet.  The blackberry center actually tasted like blackberries and not that fake, super sweet, not-real-fruit taste.  The graham crust compliments the blackberries.  The wrappers keep the bars moist so they travel well.  They are small but filling and a great snack or part of a breakfast at just 110 calories each.  I will buy these again. ",6,cerealbar
"These bars are GREAT!  Very tasty. No high fructose corn syrup.  I bought them for my toddler-age sons, both of whom really liked similar bars from Gerber and NutriGrain.  I was really shocked and disappointed to learn that those bars had high fructose corn syrup, though. (Seriously? A bar specifically for BABIES has HFCS?!)  So I opted for these.  They LOVE them, and so do I.  But I get them for 2.79/box locally. Even the most expensive grocery store around has them for 3.29/box.  I'm all for convenience, but we go through way too many boxes of these for it to be worth paying an extra fifty cents or a dollar (or more - price seems to vary by flavor here) more per box. ",6,cerealbar
I love Kashi products.  I eat one of these every day.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon's price of this product and food products in general.  You can get this at local stores (you know the Red and the Blue one) for less than 3 dollars a box. ,6,cerealbar
"I am not always sold on Kashi products because some just taste a little too healthy for me (even though I do like to eat healthy).  This bar is delicious however.  It is comparable to nutri grain bars but is actually good for you.  The blackberry center is so good, yum. ",6,cerealbar
"I just got 4 (24 per case) cases of it and all I can say is....BUY IT! Nice boost, great taste, AWESOME Company! They care about their customers! Hansens....You guy's are AWESOME!!!!! ",7,energy_drink
"I have horrible luck...everything that I like is either discontinued from the store, is no longer available for purchase, or they just stop making whatever it is I like. My boyfriend recommened I try and order my favorite energy drink (Hansen's Energy Pro) online...and holy cow I could!! The previous week, Whole Foods (the only store I could find this product) told me they discontinued it (along with the cereal I liked) and I was disappointed. But, come to find out I could order this through Amazon!!! I placed the order and within a day or two recieved half of my shipment!! It was a really good ordering experience and I get to enjoy my favorite energy drinks everyday!! Thank God For The Internet! I would recommend this enery drink to anyone who loves a great tasting Hansen product. ",7,energy_drink
"THIS IS THE BEST TASTING ENERGY DRINK ON EARTH, AND THE HARDEST TO FIND!!  THANK GOD AMAZON HAS IT, I CANT LIVE WITHOUT AT LEAST 2 A DAY, MY WHOLE BEING HAS AWAKENED WI DRINK IT, MONSTER, RED BULL, AND ALL THE OTHER NASTY DRINKS OUT THERE DOESNT DESERVE TO BE MENTIONED IN THE SAME BREATH AS THIS!! SO IF YOU WANT THE GOOD STUFF THAT WILL GIVE YOU REAL ENERGY, THIS IS IT, IF YOU  WANT THE CELEBRITY NASTY TASTING DRINK OF CHOICE TRY RED BULL OR MONSTER!! ",7,energy_drink
"This energy drink is extremely hard to find.I called Hansen's to find it. It is made in small amounts at a time with great ingredients, natural.It's the only energy drink my husband and I drink. It's pricey but worth it. ",7,energy_drink
"Used to drink it then all of the local stores stopped carrying it so I assumed they stopped making it, glad I stumbled upon it on Amazon.  Great price too.  I wish Hansen's would bring back Energade, that drink was great. ",7,energy_drink
"Personally, I couldn't feel an immediate jolt, but, it taste good and i think it does give me sustained energy. I have 2 boys 9 and 11,  I let them have half a can each and they haven't had a negative reaction. ",7,energy_drink
It is good. Don't get the jittery feeling like with other energy drinks. I mix mine with ice for a slush or fruit juice and it works well. ,7,energy_drink
this is the greatest natural energy drink its light in flvor delcious....the price could be better dont have four more words...HOw stupid ,7,energy_drink
"Ordered this for my Husband back in June and he said they were all flat.  It taste as if the cans had been opened and left in the frig.  We are going to try one more time, maybe we just got a bad batch.  Will come back and let you know.  I don't know how long they stay in the warehouse, we'll see. ",7,energy_drink
I have used this product for years and have been very happy drinking it.  I have recommended it to friends and family. It was available in a couple of local stores but unable to find it now so I am very pleased to purchase it through Amazon. ,7,energy_drink
"This is the perfect energy drink: it's not too sweet,it's not too sour or taste like medicine and best of all it's 8 oz ( instead of having to force down a 12-16 oz energy drink. It really is the best tasting drink out there. ",7,energy_drink
"my 2 cents- this drink gets my creative juices going and not at all bad on the wallet. Overall hansen's is a great product and once again they nailed on it-offering us ""health freaks"" an alternative soda. I hope they keep ENERGY PRO in production! ",7,energy_drink
"Hansen's is a company that makes all natural products, so I'm more inclined to lean toward their products than others on the market anyway.  However, this drink is great no matter who makes it.  It doesn't have all the other additives in other drinks, and doesn't leave you shaky like other energy drinks. It's the only energy drink I will use, and this is the cheapest way to get it! ",7,energy_drink
"I thought I would give this drink a shot after reading so many positive reviews for it on here. It wasn't bad, but I guess I was just expecting something a bit...more? It tastes a little better than most energy drinks, but also seems to provide a little less energy. Not great, not bad, just average. ",7,energy_drink
I did not like product. made me sick. I have tried other energy products and this one was not to good. I had to throw away the other cans. ,7,energy_drink
"Not only is the taste great, but this drink does not make me feel edgy after drinking it. And I don't get a &#34;caffeine hangover&#34; after drinking it. Also, it always ships fast and in good packaging. ",7,energy_drink
"I like the taste of this product but it is not natural like it claims to be. The caffeine is synthetic and does not come from natural sources. It is also full of sugar. 33 grams per can. If you want a cheaper version of red bull, this might be for you. But if you are looking for NATURAL energy, this is definitely not your choice. ",7,energy_drink
"best energy drink flavor, since they stopped making Rumba juice...pain to get it tho..not available in any stores these days ",7,energy_drink
Great tasting alternative to coffee ... I'm not a monster I'm just a runner .. This drink suits me just fine ,7,energy_drink
"I decided to buy this product based on Hanson's reputation for quality natural beverages. I was hoping for a healthier alternative to the numerous products of dubious quality available in the local stores.  Unfortunately, the second ingrediant in this drink is sugar, and it tastes like it, too. Somewhere in the neighborhood of Mountain Dew if memory serves me correctly. If you like super sweet drinks and don't mind high doses of refined sugar, you probably won't have a problem with this product. It does give an energy boost (though it took two cans), but it has the expected rapid sugar crash when it wears off. If you drink Monster, Red Bull etc., Hanson's won't be a step down, but for those looking for an energy boost without the crap and the side effects, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N0TPVQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/177-7330441-7954855"">SAMBAZON Organic Amazon Energy Drink, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>. Quality results and ingredients are worth the price. ",7,energy_drink
"Taste was fine, and I did feel somewhat more energized, but not the quite the feeling I get with Red Bull....wonder if it's mostly psychological at this point anyway....would buy again though ",7,energy_drink
"It has become my coffee in the morning, so happy to find it on line as no stores in my area sell it! ",7,energy_drink
"I like the citrus flavor. The crisp flavor, not so sweet, makes a wonderful drink. Just the right size. A great way to start your day. ",7,energy_drink
I love this product and it is very hard to find.  Thank goodness Amazon is handling it.  It is easy to order and comes speedy ,7,energy_drink
"I was hooked on PRO-ENERGY studying all night for midterms for Electrical Engineering and have not been able to stop drinking them! They are slowly vanishing from shelves and Amazon is about the only place left to get them. Has a citrus tast that is enjoyable, unlike any of the other energy or Monster drinks that taste like cough syrup ",7,energy_drink
"Might not have as much caffeine or wake up power, but this stuff is delicious.  It's very refreshing. Highly recommend. ",7,energy_drink
Great stuff! We love it! Great taste and awesome energy! Tremendous drink that all will enjoy. Love the taste and the energy it provides! ,7,energy_drink
"This product wakes me up right away.  Not all energy drinks do that for me (I've fallen asleep to brands like 5 hour energy and Amp, before).  I think it is the Ginkgo Biloba in addition to the normal energy drink products that is doing the trick.  This is a great deal for the price. ",7,energy_drink
I like to hide one of these halfway down a long hiking trail preferably in a cold stream.  Then on the way up I grab it and enjoy a boost and treat.  I really like the flavor of these also. ,7,energy_drink
"Hansen's is the best tasting energy drink ever'(in my opinion). It also has the most vitamins as far as i can tell. I have not seen any others with more than just B vitamins. Everybody that leaves a positive review has tried it before ordering it on Amazon. It is no surprise that the number one complaint is lack of availability. But if you try it and dont like it please dont leave a bad review or low star rating based only on opinion. Hansen's has lower carbonation, lower caffeine, and lower sugar. It is the taste that has everybody hooked on it. Just because you dont like the taste, there is no need to say negative things when it is not a quality control issue. Also in my experience any problems with packaging is the handling from delivery guys flying over railroad tracks or tossing stuff around. I highly recommend ordering this from amazon ",7,energy_drink
"single serving size, great taste, just the right energy boost. I'll probably use as long as Hansen continues to make it ",7,energy_drink
"Great tasting energy drink that delivers more than just a jittery feeling.  Very clean feeling to it.  If you're looking for the ultimate boost, this may not be it.  It is a great tasting energy drink that delivers a clean energy without all the jitters and/or nervous energy. ",7,energy_drink
"I send Hansen's Energy Pro to my son who is in the Army; wherever he is.  I have sent it to Iraq, Afghanistan, and currently to Hawaii.  It is his favorite and it is the least I can do for him. ",7,energy_drink
had it in local &#34;Sam's&#34; .. got discontinued :(  found it in local health food store .. way to expensive there. easy to get it on line and good/Sam's price or lower ;) ,7,energy_drink
"Pleasant flavor, doesn't make you jittery, no weird additives. Best tasting of all similar products, by far. Hard to find in stores, sometimes at Sam's Club but inconsistent & haven't seen for a while from that source. ",7,energy_drink
"Hansen's Energy Pro has exceptional flavor, the size is just right, it boosts up your energy level, your tiredness is gone and you feel fresh and invigorated. It also has B vitamins. We love it. ",7,energy_drink
"I use this as a mixer with my favorite tequila. It is very refreshing, even by itself. Used to get it at Whole Foods Store. But now I can't find it any where.I will be ordering more. ",7,energy_drink
"Best energy drink on the market. It's a lime flavor (like Amp). Very smooth (unlike Amp), until you have too many, which you shouldn't do. ",7,energy_drink
"By far the best energy drink on the market.  May not be as strong as some of the others on the market, but it does not make you nervous, or give you that fast rush.  It seems to just wake you up enough to give you a positive clear mind for work.  I love this product.  I wish it was easier to find in stores. ",7,energy_drink
"Since their inception, Hansen's all natural sodas have been the standard by which all other sodas are judged.  The energy version is quite the same:  similar to other energy drinks but with natural ingredients, all in perfect balance.  No jittery rush, no sudden crash. ",7,energy_drink
My husband and I both love these energy drinks.  They are fairly light and have a citrus flavor that we both like without tasting like you are drinking syrup.  I wish they weren't so hard to find!  We have to have them shipped to us and can really only find them on Amazon now. ,7,energy_drink
"I love this product!  It has a clean fruity taste.  Like all energy drinks however, it should be served very cold.  I am so glad that Amazon offers it for sale since I can't find it in any local stores.  Thanks Amazon! ",7,energy_drink
These are smoother than red bull and my favorite. Citrus with a twang. DONT BUY THESE I WANT THEM ALL FOR ME ,7,energy_drink
"Love the energy it gives me, just wish the company  what make it easier to find and buy in stores . ",7,energy_drink
"I have been using this product for ten years. It was my alternative to coffee in the morning. I would purchase a 36 count case at smart and final for around 28.00. Now you cant find it locally. I even live in the same city as the factory, so I called and the rep said that they are still selling it to the stores and I should ask the manangers to order it for me, which I have done several times at several stores. It never comes in on the truck. Hansen is flooded with calls complaining that it is no longer available locally. The rep said that she is going to talk to the owner and call me back after their March meeting. We will see what happens. I was willing to drive to the factory 20 mins from me but they would not sell it to me. Hmmm was it part of the contract with amazon to pull it from the local stores so we would have to buy it online for a higher price? I noticed that now they offer a subscription to have it delivered on a monthly basis! One sec let me take a sip of this 5 hr energy drink...ahhhh okay. So like I was saying this kinda sounds like a exclusive distribution contract with amazon to me. ",7,energy_drink
"Took a chance on this product after reading all the positive reviews.  I'm not really a fan of this product.  It was effective in terms of providing energy, but the taste wasn't quite right.  Since most energy drinks have similar ingredients, I think the problem might be too much Ginseng and/or Ginkgo Biloba or maybe something with the citrus aftertaste.  I will try something else next time since there are so many other energy drink choices out there. ",7,energy_drink
"For me this is the best energy drink ever.  Doesn't have the jolt of some of the others, it just gives that nice boost that I need sometimes, especially before a workout.  Only draw back is I have to order it so that I have it all the time.  The outlets I used to purchase this from (Sam's Club, Smart & Final) don't consistently carry it.  I hope Amazon keeps it available. ",7,energy_drink
"I love this energy drink! As usual, Hansens does an excellent job at making a natural product. Other energy drinks give me a headache from the high amount of caffeine, but this drink gives me the right amount of energy with no headaches or other side effects. Love it! ",7,energy_drink
"I decided to give Hansen's Energy Pro (sold at the local 7-Eleven) a try, because it was a dollar cheaper than Red Bull. Wow, what an amazing difference. First, it tastes way better than Red Bull. Secondly, it gives you sustained energy for hours with no crash and burn like other energy drinks. The only problem drinking Hansen's is sometimes forgetting it's 7 pm or after, because at 3 a.m. I'm still wide awake and full of energy. Whatever Hansen's did, their scientists came up with a formula that beats other energy drinks hands down, including Sobe and many others. And do not be fooled by the cheaper price. Hansen's Energy Pro is the best energy drink on the market, like you've drank some magic elixir that transforms you from being lifeless to full of life. The energy boost lasts many hours at an even level, void of rapid heart beat or fidgety nerves. I have experienced no side effects other than feeling great. So, stellar job Hansen's. ",7,energy_drink
The old packaging contained cinnamon applesauce with only two ingredients: apples and cinnamon.  The new packages now contain apple concentrate and apple juice concentrate.  This means more sugar in your product.  The flavor is blander and sweeter.  I liked the old cinnamon apple sauce a lot better.  It had a nice appley flavor and was healthier. ,8,fruit
"The concept is great. My concern is how sugary they are. ""No sugar added""- true....sorta. They use concentrated apples which is effectively adding sugar, just not the heavily processed variety.<br /><br />At just over 3oz, each pouch has 12.3g of sugar. Granted that's not a whole lot, but I've been seeing more and more of this type of thing pop up. They tout it as no-sugar-added but they'll stir in a ton of concentrated pear or grape juice which is loaded with sugar! Fructose or glucose, it's all the same in your bloodstream.<br /><br />We've been giving our daughter unsweetened applesauce and now tasting this stuff it's dramatically more sweet. If you don't want your children to have sugar/get used to sugary tasting foods, then this is not the applesauce for you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the product is fantastic. I'd just like to see a more natural tasting version. ",8,fruit
"Food and drinks in pouches are life savers!!! The apple sauce taste as good, if not better than those in jars. Huge advantages are that they fit nicely into back packs, no spoon requirement, one had eating action, and a great quick snack. If they can put more stuff into travel pack like this, I would eat and drink everything from pouches. One complaint is the packaging. They waste way too much packing material for the bulk box. It's 4 pouches inside a card board box, then 12 of those boxes in another box. I don't plan of selling these goodies so I can do without the extra packaging. Go cheap on the extra cardboard and pass the savings on to the customers. ",8,fruit

I just want everyone to be mindful when giving these snacks to their children...even older ones. Please stress to your children to only put food into their mouths.

"My family has been using this product for years in France. If you're a kid and you're French, you've tried this product and you've loved it. My daughter and I used to go visit and we would bring some back in our suitcases every time. I'm so glad that we're now able to find it here too! Amazon's got the best price out there. GoGoSqueeZ are hard to find and to be able to buy them in bulk is great because they go fast (especially when we end up sharing them with all of her little friends!) It really is the perfect snack!

"I love these!  My two year old son takes them in his lunch to mother's day out.  I had been buying the Plum, Revolution and Ellas babyfood in the pouches so that he could have a fruit or vegetable in his lunch that he could feed himself without making a mess for his teachers to clean up.  I decided to give these a try because they are much less expensive.  They are definitely worth it!  Purchased in bulk they end up being about $.70 each compared to the $1 plus for the other brands I had been purchasing.  My son loves them and doesn't make any mess AT ALL!  I even trust him to eat them in the car on roadtrips.  The only reason I did not give five stars is that I wish they were a little larger serving and would love to purchase a bulk variety pack.  We have 48 of one flavor! ",8,fruit

"These came up under a search for organic applesauce, however they are not organic. Apples and peaches are both on the dirty dozen list (produce with the highest pesticide residue rates) and should not be eaten unless they are organic.  We tried to return them, but found that they were not returnable. We were very disappointed. ",8,fruit
"My kids loved these, but unfortunately after nearly a year of buying them I have to stop.  Why?  As other users stated, the ingredients changed for the worse (now including concentrates) and the worst part is that $25.xx used to get you a 48 pack using s&s, now it is $29.xx and it is no longer worth it to buy online. ",8,fruit
My kids absolutely love these and will choose them over many other sugary options.  They are very simple to take around and do not promote a mess.  My only issue is they do not have a large amount of nutional value - I would expect more fiber and vitamins from these.<br /><br />But they are certainly better than the normal choices kids have for snacks. ,8,fruit

"My children liked applesauce ok before receiving these.  I don't know if it's because of the packaging, but they LOVE applesauce now.  I find myself drinking/eating one of these every now and then as well.  The applesauce is delicious and as stated pretty much mess free.  My 22 month old squeezed more out than necessary once, now he has the hang of it.

The appleapple, applebanana, and applecinnamon packets were the perfect solution for snacks and on-the-go. I was furious when I discovered that not only was the package new, but there were new ingredients in the applesauce. Neither of my son's can eat these now without having pretty severe reactions. I am so disappointed and am no longer a consumer of this product. Back to the drawing board to find a product that my children can eat. ",8,fruit

"When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these.  Not Until my father had handed it to my hungry daughter one day.  It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car.  You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped.  Being diabetic he needed something fast.  He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour.  When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control.  Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough.  So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital.  For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.

"My 6 y/o,  4 y/o, and 18 month old all love these. They are perfect for school lunches and when on the go.  We get them at Costco which is MUCH cheaper. $7.59 for 16.  It's only the plain apple flavor though which is why I am online searching for other flavors.  My kids are fine with the plain apple though. ",8,fruit
"I love these for when I jog long distances - instead of using the gels; it's got the re-closable top and I like the taste.  Well, I actually like the apple WAY better than the apple/banana.  Also, I keep a box in the car and at work... it's a quick easy and CONVENIENT snack... so I don't have to worry about being tempted in going to a drive thru when I'm hungry.  I'm betting kiddies would like it - as it's similar to a sippy box ;) ",8,fruit
The product itself is yummy and my 14 month old seems to enjoy it but I sliced my finger when I reached into the box to grab one. The corner was not rounded properly and is pretty sharp. Make sure you check yours before giving it to the kid. I rounded all of mine with a pair of scissors. I'll post a picture. ,8,fruit

When my grandson is over he does not head to the candy dish on the table he wants to have an ""apple squeezer"" as he calls it.  When he leaves he always asks to take another along.  We use these to take along on road trips too, no mess, no fuss just twist off the cap and consume.  Buying by the case is the way to go and the apple-cinnamon is our favorite but we do like all the flavors. ",8,fruit
GoGo Squeez applesauce on the Go are by far the best tasting ones available.  We like the apple peach and apple apple.  We haven't tried the apple strawberry but I'm sure it would be yummy too.  They aren't just for kids and are a great on-the-go snack.  Would highly recommend them! ,8,fruit

Amazon's price is the best I've found.  This is my family's favorite flavor.  Seriously, we eat these every day. ",8,fruit

"I've found the GoGo Squeez applesauce pouches to be a really useful tool for a diabetic! Toss a couple in your gym bag or just in your purse as you dash out the door and feel safe knowing that if you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), you have a portable, efficient, pre-measured tool in your daily diabetic arsenal. Each pouch has roughly 12gms of carbohydrates (as per nutrition information the mfgr sent me) and is usually enough to do the trick for me without ""over-treating"". Doesn't need refrigeration, no mess in your purse or gym bag and yummy, too. If you *must* treat a low blood glucose, it may as well be with something you enjoy and that is wholesome, real food, I say! ",8,fruit
"We recently discovered these in the appleapple (at Costco) and decided to take a chance on the applepeach thanks to the lower price and another reviewer here mentioning they liked both of those flavors. These taste much better than a store brand we tried. Without actually having both around at once, my kids say they think the peach and apple taste about the same. I actually think the peach is more tart, and I'm going to get the 48 pack of appleapple next time. Having tried apple-strawberry and apple-banana in the store brand, I'm not going to risk those flavors in a 48-pack, even though I'm sure GoGo SqueeZ would taste a least a little better. One of my kids hated the strawberry and neither really liked the banana (although I think I would personally like the GoGo banana).<br /><br />These are super-convenient and the kids grab them first for their lunches and healthy snacks. I would give them 5 stars if they were just a little bigger. They seem to be gone before you know it. They are 3.2 oz and applesauce cups are 4 oz. My kids never take the cups though, because they don't want to hassle with the spoon and mess. The only thing I would warn people about with these is that everyone I've seen try them baulks a little at first--maybe it's the getting used to drinking your applesauce thing. Kids and adults, both seem to need to give it another try after first thinking they don't really like it. Now my kids love it and I find myself grabbing them frequently too.<br /><br />Should you buy the 48-pack if you've never tried it? I asked myself if I could handle eating them all myself if the kids wouldn't (my answer was yes), so I think that's a good way to decide. You could also always donate them, although they're a little pricey for that. I think you should start with the appleapple first if you've never tried any (assuming you and your kids do like applesauce). ",8,fruit

"Mornings in our house can be a frantic time. Packing lunches, breakfast, etc. Having these pouches sure does make it easy to get a little bit of fruit in my daughter's (10) lunch, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids bigger/older. It's just not enough and it's too expensive for what you get. The applesauce inside isn't bad, but it's definitely not Mott's chunky. And depending on your child, a lot of applesauce is wasted because they don't squeeze it all out of the pouch. The cap can be tough for some younger kids to open too. But the idea has merit and for those who want a little (keyword: little) applesauce with their lunch or snack, this is easy to bring along. ",8,fruit
"There doesn't seem to be much applesauce in these so my 2 year old goes through 2-3 at a time, making this a not so cheap snack since there are 4 per pack.

"I am not diurnal. Seriously, when you suggest to me that I do anything before 11am, I will look at you funny. But I have a corporate job now, which starts very early and requires me to get up even earlier to give time for the caffeine to kick in. And the idea of eating actual food at that point is frankly sort of disturbing.<br /><br />You know how they say that eating an apple is supposed to wake you up better than drinking a cup of coffee? I never believed it until I bought some of these on sale at walmart. I wake up in the morning and chug down one of my &#34;apple sauce juice boxes&#34; and feel like a human being rather than the walking dead 60% faster. And although they do contain some concentrated juice, they have a lot more natural ingredients than a lot of the processed meal bars and such I feel up to eating at the crack of dawn. And yes, I seriously feel an energy boost after eating them, although I can't promise that it's not psychological.<br /><br />I've tried the Apple Berry and the Mango. I liked both but the Mango is an acquired taste, I think because no one else I know liked it. These have 60 calories, fit in your purse, natural ingredients, and take about a minute to eat. In short, they should not just be dismissed as part of the diaper bag kit, you should grab some today and keep them for when you need a quick fruit induced sugar rush. ",8,fruit

"I did not believe that there could be a zero calorie, soy free , gluten free noodle that actually tastes good. But I believe now thanks to Miracle Noodle. For those of you that have already made the switch from regular pasta to wheat pasta; your next switch will be to Miracle Noodles. I was amazed to find that unlike some pastas/noodles this product absorbs flavor and cooks quickly. I have prepared these in stir fries with such things as olive oil, pasta sauces, and chicken broth. All of my meals have come out great and the best part is that they leave you feeling full. The second best part is that you do not feel guilty later for having eaten a noodle. I have tried all of the Miracle Noodle products and am still deciding which one is my favorite. Obviously I am a big fan and think others will quickly become one too. ",9,pasta
"these aren't as bad as the fettucini noodles. Again, no flavor making them versatile and easy to put in many dishes. The texture is still rubbery and chewy, but they aren't as thick as the fettucini so for myself they are more tolerable. They do in fact fill you up quickly! ",9,pasta
"This product is supposed to help you manage your weight loss by allowing you to eat ""noodles"" without the carbs and calories in real pasta. The idea is that it fills you up with zero calories because it is made only from plant fiber. I was excited about the idea and didn't mind paying over $2.00 a bag since it's cheaper on Amazon than on the company website. When the noodles got here I followed the cooking directions and seasoned them using my favorite sauce. Then I took the first big bite. This was a mistake! The noodles have a slimey, rubbery texture that kind of pops when you bite into it. All I could imagine was that this is what eating worms must feel like. I managed to choke down the first bite and tried one more time just to be sure, but I just couldn't finish another bite. I was so disappointed. I guess maybe it's my fault for expecting these ""noodles"" to taste like real pasta. Now I have the other 5 bags just sitting in my pantry. I won't be buying these again. ",9,pasta
"If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that. Although the fishy smells washes off with proper rinsing and boiling the texture of the noodles is nauseating. I was literally gagging as I tried to swallow them. When you chew them they break a part like some odd watery substance. I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all! Plus, you can find them in your local grocery store for much cheaper (they are called shirataki noodles) ",9,pasta
"I gave these noodles a try and although they are not the tastiest they still get the job done.  I am amazed at the nutrition label.  Calories?  Zero.  Total Fat?  None.  Cholestrol?  Absolutely not.  No sugars, no protein, no guilt.  I have been trying to lose weight for quite some time with different diets and these noodles are getting the job done.  They do have a scent when open but that goes away once you rinse under cold water as the cooking instructions states.  I wouldn't recommend eating these noodles by itself.  Instead, add to a pasta sauce, a salad dressing or soup and it'll taste fine.  They absorb the sauce very well.  Perhaps the best thing about them is they make you feel full after eating just one 7oz package. ",9,pasta
"If you want a noodle without the guilt, well, this ain't it.  Better to limit your ""real"" noodle intake and enjoy it than suffer with this.  I've tried Tofu Shirataki Noodles from the local health food store which are a bit better, but nothing replaces the real thing.  These are rubbery, no flavor really, and don't digest well.  Save your shekels. ",9,pasta
"I'm sorry but I gotta go with the ""nasty"" crowd here.  The smell, oye...the look, well they kind of look like little intestines...the texture, pure rubber and sort of give you the feeling of biting thru stringy grissle.  Cudos to the folks who can do them, I wish I could but there are some things I can't even do for zero calories. ",9,pasta
These things were nasty!  I understood they have no flavor of their own but absorb the flavor of whatever you put them in.  That was not the issue.  The texture was so weird I could not eat them.  Rubbery doesn't even beging to describe them....  I tried several different ways to make them and nothing was any good. ,9,pasta
"After reading about Shirataki noodles I knew I had to try it. Turns out this is just like the noodles I ate in sukiyaki while growing up. Throw these noodles in any stir-fry or soups, really great. I see some people don't like the taste but it really has no taste. It takes on the flavors of whatever is surrounding it. It can be used as a substitute for rice noodle or soba for those of you are into Asian cooking. Great service from this vendor. ",9,pasta
"They aren't really like spaghetti, more like a rice noodle.  Yes, they do smell bad at first.  There is nothing rubbery about the texture in my opinion.  I decided to try these to cut back on carbs.  I put milk in a pan and added butter, fresh garlic, and a little parmesan cheese.  Then I tossed the noodles in.  We really liked them. ",9,pasta
"Yes, they stink - like rotting fish! You can rinse the smell away and add whatever you like, BUT the consistency of these noodles (I got the angel hair and prepared with my favorite homemade spaghetti sauce) is very rubbery. After smelling them initially, and then feeling as though I was chewing on tiny earthworms, I managed to down two forkfuls and threw the rest away. Color me crazy, but I'd rather have half a cup of real, delicious, high-carb pasta than a gallon of Miracle Noodles. What's that you said? Would I care for more Miracle Noodles? No, thanks, I'm having portion control. ",9,pasta
I'm pretty tolerant of foods that don't taste good but this was literally the worst food product I have ever bought. probably. It tastes like rubber and it doesn't fill you up at all. I ate it with tomato pasta sauce and it was still gross. Also it gave me diarrhea which is really gross. NOT RECOMMENDED. ,9,pasta
"After reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical that these would be edible, but after trying them I think the bad reviews are based on an unfair expectation that these are a replacement for wheat/flour pasta.  These actually are a fairly good substitute for Asian style glass noodles and work well in stir fry and soup dishes.  After rinsing I tossed them into a stir fry pan with various veggies some spices and a bit of soy sauce and except for the slightly tougher texture the dish came out tasting like noodle take out from our local Chinese restaurant.  I wouldn't think they would hold up as well in a traditional spaghetti style dish but when prepared with a thinner sauce and left to cook long enough to absorb the other flavors of the dish they can be quite tasty.  One of the most filling meals I've had since trying to watch my calorie intake. ",9,pasta
"My husband and I are on Atkins and decided to try these ""noodles"".  I'd rather make ""pasta"" out of zucchini or some other veggie.  I prepped it as per the instructions.  I rinsed it longer than necessary, boiled it for a minute and then decided to pan fry it for good measure.  I made an alfredo sauce for it and tossed some in while in the pan since it's supposed to absorb flavors.  My husband took one bite and said no way.  He couldn't get past the texture.  I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken, but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it, but just couldn't.  I'll wait a few weeks 'till I can have the low carb pasta.  This is totally not worth it.  Sadly, I ordered it from the Miracle Noodle site so I have several bags left.  I may try again, but most likely they will end up in the trash. ",9,pasta
"I thought that I should try a single pack from my local co op before buying multiples. So glad I only bought one pack. These smell horrible, like chemicals. The texture is mushy and not pleasing at all. I would never recommend these to anyone. I am going to try kelp noodles as a replacement for these. ",9,pasta
"I was so excited to try these noodles but very very disappointed. It wasn't the smell, which is basically rinsed away when you wash them before cooking. It was the consistency of this noodle, the texture was very slimy and difficult to register as a noodle in my mouth. My husband did like them and I'll fix them for him but they are an absolute no-go for me. ",9,pasta
"Cartilage, that is the word I would use to describe. Followed instructions on the package. Both my daughter and I could not take a second bite. Very disappointed! ",9,pasta
"I am currently on a No Carb diet and bought these noodles. I think the important note here is that you MUST rinse them at least 3 times before cooking them and then again after. They are shipped in a liquid filled bag (which doesn't smell too pleasant) and before I prepare them I rinse them at least 3 times and separate them with my hands under running water to make sure I rinsed off all of the liquid. They take a minute to cook and are basically flavorless. They soak up the flavor of whatever they are cooked in so I like to cook them in broth or salty water. After they are cooked, I drain them, rinse them again and then lay them out to drain some more on a towel. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but being able to enjoy a bowl of ""pasta"" after a long week is definitely worth the effort and there's no guilt afterwards! There are two servings per bag, but I eat both of them as they actually count as a vegetable serving. If you are used to angel hair sized pasta, this should be an easy adjustment. ENJOY! ",9,pasta
"These gems remind me of thai ""glass"" noodles, they're s bit stretchy and slightly chewy. Made in the USA, they're a great base for quick healthy meals, stir frys being my favorite. I stir-fry veggies, chicken base and cilantro, add protein (chicken or egg), microwave the noodles for 60 sec. and top them w/ stirfry.  Note these noodles aren't made of semolina, so don't expect them to be the same as semolina noodles. They do have a slight smell that I find it appealing, but other some reviewers have found it undesirable. Give them a try- they're a smart choice for anyone who's health and taste conscious. Unbelievable that these are ZERO calories! ",9,pasta
"I am from a generation which does not throw away food. But these noodles went in the trash.  Some of the 1 star reviews were correct in stating the texture as being the primary problem. This is a great way to ruin a good meal by using these noodles as a base. Rubbery describes them well. It's like your mouth does not know what to do with them. I don't gag easily, but this had me close. There are other ways to lose weight, which do not include this kind of food torture. They do not even deserve a single star. Buyer beware. ",9,pasta
"They're actually quite taste-less but the problem is that they &#34;squeak&#34; in the mouth like rubber  it's just too hard to get past the squeaking, it's awful. ",9,pasta
"I think these are a fine substitute for pasta.  Anyone needing gluten free or carb free - this product is for you!  They are packaged in what I think is a single serving size, so plan accordingly.  They're packaged in liquid, which is weird and the liquid doesn't smell good.  But hold your breath when you open them and rinse very well and the smell is gone.  They're translucent and chewy and have no flavor on their own. If you rinse and then pat dry they lose some of their gumminess. Like tofu, they take on the flavor of whatever you cook with them.  Don't even think about trying to eat them on their own. We've had them several times in spaghetti sauce and been satisfied.  They are filling. ",9,pasta
"There was a person who reviewed this product that said those who rated it 5 stars are exaggerating, and those who rated it 1 star are doing the same.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The noodles does smell fishy right out of the package, but rinse it under hot water for a minute and the smell will go away.  As far as the texture is concerned, it is exactly like the Filipino noodles that are made of mung beans called sotanghon.  It is NOT like eating cartilage.  It absorbs the flavor of whatever you are adding to it which makes them versatile.  The possibilities wiht what you can make out of them is endless.  The best thing about it is that it has zero calories, zero fat, zero sugar, and zero carbs.  Whoever invented this should get an award. ",9,pasta
"THe noodles were very rubbery & the texture was not at all like food. You could bury it in sauce to make it taste like food, but cant get away from the rubbery texture. I do not recommend this product. ",9,pasta
"Fishy smell yes, weird texture yes. The smell really gets to me I have to hold my breath while im rinsing them. Then I boil them. And then put some light Alfredo sauce in them and the smell goes away. Texture is like they burst with water in your mouth... maybe im not patting them enough with paper towels. Very diet life saving. ",9,pasta
"I purchased these after watching a youtube video of a woman using them to make spaghetti with ground turkey. WHen they arrived, I already anticipated the smell upon opening the package and the texture possible being ""weird"". Must say, I have already eaten all six packages in different ways but my favorite dish was the spaghetti.  When I opened the small bag, The smell was fishy but I allowed them to rinse while I chopped my veggies. The texture was very similar to noodles but more like an asian noodle (like the noodle used for pad woon sen or ramen noodles)They really soaked up the flavor of the sauces I used. I will be ordering my next shipment today! I am completely impressed and will probably use these for my spaghetti from now on! ",9,pasta
"From the other reviews, I expected these to stink up my kitchen. They didn't, there is just a bit of a fishy smell like you'd get if you opened a bag of frozen seafood. No big deal. They aren't like pasta noodles, they have the same kind of feel in my mouth as the seaweed salad I order at sushi restaurants. To prepare these, I dried them really well with paper towels (they come in a bag of water), then sprayed a pan with Pam and basically stir fried them with cilantro and soy sauce. For no calories, utterly fantastic! ",9,pasta
"there is no miracle in these noodles to losing weight. the smell and look of these alone, once you open the package is enough to make you lose your appetite for a few days. I threw them out before i threw up ",9,pasta
"Although this product is better for you than pasta, nothing beats the taste of real pasta. I just can't get past the texture of these noodles, they are chewy and gummy and gelatin all at the same time. ",9,pasta
"I have a condition that limits the amount and kind of carbs I can eat, and these noodles are a very happy replacement for many recipes. If you prepare them according to package directions, they are excellent in any pasta dish. My favorite way to eat them is with chili topped with cheese. Yummy! ",9,pasta
"My whole family loves this product, I find that it is a great substitute to the over processed noodles you buy in the store. I find that it takes very little to make me full and it is helping me to maintain my weight.  Thank you for this product!! ",9,pasta
These noodles smell bad when you open the bag! You've been warned. But it goes away when you mix the noodles in with sauces and spices. Its a nice addition to a stir fry. ,9,pasta
Nice to have found a way to get my pasta fix without putting on the pounds.  And a good source of fiber too. Two thumbs up... ,9,pasta
"Wish I'd discovered these ages ago! Tried them for the first time a year ago, and haven't had any other pasta since. Yes they're a bit gelatinous, and you do have to wash them, but they satisfy the pasta craving without adding any calories: priceless. Try making them with Kraft's fat-free mozzarella cheese and Hunt's sugar-free pasta sauce for a super-healthy, high-protein, low-carb pasta. ",9,pasta
This product is a good bargain when ordered by subscription. You just can't beat 0 calorie pasta...just be sure to follow the directions EXACTLY! and ignore the smell before you rinse them! ,9,pasta
"I have no idea how anyone could eat this vile crap.  It was impossible to get down, even with good marinara sauce and plenty of parmesan. ",9,pasta
"All these negative reviews scared me to try the Miracle Noodle. But after researching I came to a conclusion that it won't hurt to try. It's all natural, it's nothing but fiber and it's 0 calories. When I first opened the package, the fish smell overwhelmed me. But after running through hot water for a couple minutes, the smell disappeared completely. I didn't even have to boil it to get rid of the smell. First night I made chicken lomain with boiled chicken breast, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Second night I made chicken alfredo with broccoli. The good thing about these noodles is that they have no taste what so ever, which opens up to unlimited possibility. You can literally do anything with these. I love them already. I actually like the texture of the noodles, and most of all, I love that I can stuff my face without having to worry about calories. I most definitely recommend it to fellow dieters! ",9,pasta
"I'm currently on a low carb diet and these noodles saved me from cheating!!  After reading the reviews, I made sure that I rinsed them very well in cold water, then I boiled them for a bit.  Once that was done, I threw them in a pan with Braggs Liquid Aminos, asparagus, Tilapia, and spices and I was in heaven.  So satisfying and filling.  I wish I would've know about this product sooner.  I definitely recommend you try it!! ",9,pasta
"I wanted to like these noodles more than I do.  They are filling and nutritious, but they take more preparation than I was expecting from a pre-formed noodle, and I find that they clump badly when mixed into a sauce. ",9,pasta
"These noodles serve decently as a filler. They have no taste of their own but absorb the taste of what you mix them in. The smell is mildly unpleasant but goes away with rinsing. Preparation is fairly easy and quick. I can see these being useful on a short-term low-carb diet as a filler, but certainly not long-term. You'd get about the same thing if you bought a can of bamboo shoots used to make chop suey, and it would be a lot cheaper. ",9,pasta
"I purchased these to help me lose weight while on the HCG Diet. I will admit that when I first opened them, I had to smell them based on the comments in other reviews. They do have a seafood type of smell but, following directions closely will quickly eliminate that, (rinse for 15 seconds or so). I blanched them as was instructed to, for a minute, strained them, seasoned them with a little lemon pepper seasoning and mixed with a seasoned chicken broth and some cooked shrimp. Mmmmmm they were perfect!! I had been missing the pastas that I used to love and this was close enough. Love them and will definitely buy them again! ",9,pasta
"I really don't understand all the negative reviews. These noodles aren't made with eggs/flour/any of the normal components of pasta,of course they aren't going to taste like your average spaghetti dish and dousing them in ragu isn't going to make them as such. Great alternative to pasta if you're on a low-everything diet. ",9,pasta
"I've switched to a low carb lifestyle and one of the most challenging things to eat is things that I would traditionally eat with rice or pasta... like mac and cheese or thai curry. For years I've been getting konnyaku noodles from the Asian grocer but I was happy when I found these as a I have a little more faith in their actual contents. The trick to shirataki/konnyaku is to let them sit in a flavor rich sauce so they absorb the flavor. Don't prepare them plain and expect them to taste good, cuz they won't. They don't really taste or smell fishy to anyone who actually knows what fish smells and tastes like, but they do have a different odor. Lately my favorite preparation is to parboil them, then soak in an Alfredo sauce prepared with Cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. A ramen restaurant near me recently started giving the option of shirataki noodles in place of wheat noodles, so I've been meaning to try them as an instant ramen or instant udon replacement because they are awesome in ramen!! There are some really rich Korean stews that would do well with these in place of rice as well. Be creative and experiment, but most of all, keep your mind open!! ",9,pasta
I reluctantly bought these noodles after ready many reviews...some good and some really bad. I'm SO glad I tried them. They definitely do have a fishy smell when you open the package but I wasn't shocked as I had read that. Once rinsed they didn't smell at all. I followed the package directions exactly...blanch in boiling water for one minute then dry on a paper towel and toss into your dish. I added them to a stir fry and they tasted awesome. I let them sit in the soy sauce marinade for about 10 minutes before adding them. They totally soaked up the flavor of the sauce. They tasted like rice noodles would. Not sure I would try them in a traditional pasta dish but for Asian or Chinese style dishes I think they are great. Since they are filling and have no calories they are definitely magic in my book!! ,9,pasta
I received these today and can say anyone whining about the smell is a baby the smell isn't that bad even before washing them. They have absolutely NO TASTE which is great because they can go with anything. I tried them plain and no taste at all then I reheated some chili I made for dinner last night and it came out great mixed in. I would recommend that you start out with a smaller or thinner product when first trying them. Just realized I did order the Angel hair but received fettuccini but will be keeping them anyway since I already ate some. They do have a weird texture but with anything new it will take some getting used to & it's not so weird you can't eat it. I saw others claiming it was like jello but it's more like a noodle not cooked completely. ,9,pasta
"I had similar noodles more than a year ago. They smelled awfully fishy and had a chewy texture. I didn't like them. I was reluctant to try these, however, these noodles are greatly improved. These have hardly any smell and the texture isn't bad either. I think some really bad reviews aren't for this particular brand. If you've been cutting carbs for any amount of time, like I have, you may appreciate these. Search the internet for tips and recipes and enjoy! ",9,pasta
"These noodles are so wonderful.  They have the taste, texture and consistency of regular noodles but have no carbs, calories or fat!  I am very picky and these noodles are the closest thing to regular noodles and I am so impressed.  The only difference is that they have a more clear color than yellow.  I use them in a marinara sauce and they are wonderful.  They do smell bad when you open the bag.  You need to rinse them and boil them for a minute.  Then drain them and add them to your dish.  I don't ever taste anything bad - I look forward to my ""mock spaghetti"" meal once a week as I'm on a low carb diet.  These are helping me get through it easily.  I eat a bag once a week! ",9,pasta
"Appreciated all the reviews... I already knew to rinse in cold water and then boil for 5 min. before it arrived. It barely smelled when I opened it, and only when I stuck my nose to it was there a mild fishy smell. Gone by the time I rinsed the noodles. After boiling, I added to a can of Progresso Lite Vegetable soup for a minute or two. Tasted/felt very similar to ramen noodles, but from what I've read, this is a whole lot healthier. Just reordered; I hope to make this a diet staple. Also, I split this initial order with a friend because we were so concerned about the reviews. She also added it to Progresso Lite Soup and had similar opinion. This product is probably best for someone who already eats healthy. If you expect this to taste good with spaghetti sauce and replace your craving for pasta, you will be disappointed. ",9,pasta
"Was skeptical but had to try these for myself.  Like the other reviews they do smell a bit, not a turnoff smell though.  After you rinse in water then boil for a minute or so the smell is completely gone.  Then I sauteed in a pan w/tbsp olive oil added ground ginger and garlic, fresh parsly, tsp. yellow mustard, tsp. sugar free ketchup and 3 tbsp soy sauce and sauteed with fresh broccoli...was delis h.  I would recommend to people and just be creative with how you prepare them.  Next time I will make Pad Thai love that dish and these will work great.  Maybe I'll use the fettucini shaped ones.  All the styles of noodles are made the same just different shapes to choose from. ",9,pasta
I was pleasantly surprised with these noodles after reading some bad reviews. I prepared according to the package instructions and added a slice of cheese for flavoring and it was really good. ,9,pasta

"I purchased a combination package including this item via a Kindle Special Offer a couple of months ago. The food was packaged well and tastes fine.

"I ordered 24 of these burgers. It was my first time trying Omaha Steaks and I'm rather disappointed. While they do hold their shape well and cook fairly quickly, they do not have much flavor at all. Way too similar to regular supermarket frozen patties. They are a let down for the price. You'd get more texture, flavor, and value from standard ground beef. Definitely not worth $45. I'd give them 2 and a half stars if possible.",10,burger
"Just call me a sucker!!! Ordered a bunch of steaks, burgers, hot dogs, potatoes, and fish from Omaha Steaks. Poorest meat I have ever eaten. We can get better quality at Walmart and even better yet at the local butcher shop. Then we are bombarded with phone sales calls and junk mail. Wished I would never have fallen for ""Best Steaks you have ever eaten"". Will never purchase again.",10,burger
"Recently I received a bunch of Omaha Steak vouchers from a company that I represent. I was very excited! I cook and eat a lot of steaks so I was excited to try the famous Omaha Steak. After listening to all of their ads and looking at their pricing I expected the steaks to be of A+ quality. I ordered Ribeye and New York Strip steaks. When I received the steaks I opened the packages and the Ribeye's seemed to have reasonable marbling, and the New York Strip's looked as you would expect. Today I cooked my first four Ribeye's and boy was I disappointed. I was disappointed by the flavor, moisture, and overall quality. They were the worst steaks I've cooked in the past 5 years. I cooked the steaks on a BIg Green Egg at 600F for 3.5 minutes per side for a total cook time of 7min. This is a cooking method I have used many times. These steaks were the driest I have ever experienced using this cooking method by a long shot. The combination of a Ribeye steak and a Big Green Egg should provide you with a very moist end product. If I had bought these steaks at Wal Mart on sale for $4.99 a pound I may not have been as disappointed. These steaks are of average grocery store quality! In my opinion these steaks are the worst value I've ever experienced! Stick with Costco steaks and you wont be disappointed. Costco steaks aren't the cheapest steaks you can buy but I challenge you to find a better value in steaks. I will never order another Omaha steak in my life, even if given to me free.",10,burger
"Ordered for my elderly parents in another state on a special Christmas promotion, then visited and was able to see and taste the products. Disappointing and embarrassing! The steaks were small, thin, and tasteless. The filling of the stuffed sole, while being made with crab supposedly, was pasty and bland. The twice baked stuffed potatoes were tasty and appealing (though only the top half was filled, the rest just baked potato) but what you really want when you buy a steak package, is good steak! The advertised ""gifts"" were not even kept by my recipients, so poor were the quality of the knives. In all, a waste of money. Even at half price, not worth it!",10,burger
"the taste of the beef was very good, but the they were to tough and chewy.",10,burger
"The hamburgers were delicious, fresh and easy to cook. I will definitely order them again. Quick, COLD shipping, too!",10,burger
"The burgers were tasteless. No flavor or even salt at all. I don't know why, but I do know that it doesn't worth the money. I would not accept them even if they were for FREE!",10,burger
"Stuffed sole ok - good taste and texture. Fllet Mignon (a misnomer or a deception) tasteless and bears little resemblance of the photograph- not nearly as thick. Hamburger tasteless, fat and containing bone and cartilege fragments! My mouth still feels greasy an hour after eating it.",10,burger
"I don't know if any of you have received Burgers that were colorless, but mine were. No red at all. I wonder if they are safe to eat?",10,burger
"We ordered The Amazing Celebration through Amazon, for $80, supposedly a deep discount. The food arrived about when we expected it, and while the dry ice was gone, the food was all still frozen. So far, we've had the sirloin steak, stuffed potatoes, pork chops, chocolate cake, and stuffed sole. The sirloin and pork were decent, but no better than typical grocery store quality. The meat at Costco is better and much cheaper. The potatoes were good, and quite convenient. The chocolate cake was pretty good, and with a short time in the microwave was like an expensive ""molten chocolate"" sort of cake from a restaurant. The stuffed sole was disappointing. It was OK, but no better than what I'd expect at a cheap restaurant. In short, Omaha Steak food is less expensive than good restaurant food, but also less convenient and not nearly as good. It's more convenient than getting everything from a grocery store, but much more expensive and not as good. If convenience is your main goal, and you aren't too picky about price or quality, then Omaha Steaks is a good choice.",10,burger
Great purchase. Tender and juicy steak burgers with fantastic taste. Good price too for the package.,10,burger
"Why would you pay eight dollars per pound for ground beef? Or, double that for some tiny, flavorless steaks? Don't bother. Go to your local supermarket for better prices and better meats. Omaha Steaks seems to exist for corporate ""gift"" giving, not for anyone living in the real world.",10,burger
"I ordered the filets and was disappointed especially for the prices. They were not trimmed the way they should be, again for the price. They had this silver stuff around them. Yuk!",10,burger
"These burgers are fantastic! Anyone who is stating they are dry and not tastey or tough and chewey is not cooking them right. Sounds like you are over cooking them or not following the cooking directions. I have made them a number of different ways, pan fried, bbq grill, george foreman grilled and broiled... everytime they come out awesome! Grill or stir fry some onions with them, add a little cheddar, monteray jack or spice it up with peper jack cheese, whatever kind you like, and you got an amazing burger! Top with a little Ketchup or russian dressing if you like condiments or for some added zing lightly brush a little italian dressing on the bun before toasting. So much better than those super market slop burgers! If your not sure how best to make them, read the little book that comes with it. 15 minute flash defrost trick works great for pan frying or broiling. I have grilled them frozen fresh from the freezer on both the bbq and the g foreman grill and they come out great.In fact... I think Ill make some for dinner... AGAIN!",10,burger
"I was curious how a pre-packaged steak or burger could be. I usually make my dinners from scratch but I decided to give Omaha a spin after they opened a satellite store in Allentown. Bought the burgers, filets, asparagus and baked potatoes. Filets were thin and small. Same with the burgers. Asparagus was OK but the hollandaise sauce had no taste. Baked potatoes were OK but small. The burgers and steaks DID have a good flavor, but not worth the cost. I'll go back to buying a full tenderloin and trimming it into filets. At least I can make them a satisfying size. Tried Omaha, but didn't like it. Of course, for another $40 you can go with their ""Signature"" filets which are 2 oz bigger....NOT !",10,burger

"This is no longer a steak company. We shipped two $90 combination packages to NJ and Ohio for Christmas. It took us a long time to get our orders right because they kept wanting to charge shipping fees, which are always ridiculous. We finally decided to order extra food and pay for that instead of the shipping costs. But, on the whole, they do not perform like they once did. The food is okay to good, but not worth the cost, even with their ""deals."" Steaks were pathetic, minuscule portions of a tasteless, dry, probably commercial cuts of beef, cut neatly into squares. Omaha is a marketing direct mail firm that sells products produced by others, but packaged in their name. ""Sirloin?"" Perhaps, but we get better at Sam's and Costco at a fraction of the price. I cook professionally and we wouldn't offer their product in our restaurant. After several costly experiments, we at home are not going to use Omaha ever again. On several different occasions, they have shipped when they felt like it, not as we requested. If you read the packages included in the batch, we will see that they are goods made elsewhere and then combined under Omaha's name. The contents of two recent packages borne no resemblance to anything from Omaha, mostly from Newark, NJ and elsewhere.",10,burger
"I thought this would be a great deal, I bought a case of meat before Christmas thinking I would give some to my family. After I cooked a couple different cuts of meat up I was stunned at how low of quality the meat is. It's incredibly fatty and doesn't taste good. My cat wouldn't even eat the scraps.

"We got a gift card from Omaha Steaks and were looking forward to getting them. We paid a LOT over the $25 gift card (about $20/steak) and they were thin and looked like they were stamped out of a press. Undaunted I took one out of its pressed plastic pack and put it on the grill. Carefully tended, I took it off at the peak of doneness (by my Thermopen). It was tough and tasteless, If it was thicker, it would have been better. Local Kroger does steak to put this one to shame. Don't Buy Omaha Steaks. Go to Sam's, Trader Joe's, or Kroger.",10,burger
"I was surprised at how small everything was. You are lead to believe the potatoes are baked potatoes, but they are really really small. I bought this for an older person who just eats a tiny bit of meat, so the super small single portions were a good choice. But I can't imagine anyone else being pleased with this purchase.",10,burger

"As has everyone in America, I have seen the ads over the years for Omaha Steaks. I was always wary of them but received a gift package from dear friends this past Christmas featuring four filets and two porterhouse steaks. Nicely packaged, I had high hopes for delicious, flavorful meat. Such was not the case, however. Simply put, this is a low grade beef that pales to almost any meat I can get at a local grocer or butcher. Not only that, but when you compare by weight, you're not getting a good deal at all. Skip this obviously successful mail order firm and support your local ranchers and purveyors. You'll not only be contributing to your local economy, but you'll be rewarded with a much better product....and a more satisfying meal.",10,burger

"I received 4 of these Omaha steaks burgers free with my recent order, which was my first time ordering from Omaha steaks. Everything was frozen solid upon arrival. Through my own error I guess, for some reason I thought these were actual steaks, in the form of a burger for some odd reason. Ridiculous, I know. Turns out, they're just standard burgers. Nothing special about them really and they look nothing like they do in the picture, size/plump wise. No surprise there. Anyway, I put 1 in the fridge for a few hours to let it thaw out before throwing it on my George Foreman grill. The burger, which was small to begin with, became even smaller when I was finished cooking it even though it held its shape of being a perfect circle. The tray that catches the fat/juices filled up a little bit as it cooked. I guess it's possible I ""overcooked"" it, but I cooked it the same way I would a Bubba burger, or any other burger for that matter. I like my burgers a little crispy but like I said, these were pretty small to begin with. I have 3 left, so next time, I'll cook one on low instead of medium to see if it makes any difference but I don't see how a burger that small to begin with won't shrink after its fully cooked, seems inevitable. I mean, they are 4 oz burgers. Anyway, the burger itself was decent and somewhat tasty, nothing special though. Threw a piece of American cheese on-top and ate it, without a bun. Tasted like a standard beef patty. I got 19 grams of protein out of it, so I was happy. My girlfriend laughed hysterically though when she saw me sit down in-front of a plate with nothing but this tiny little patty on it...lol I wouldn't go out of my way to order a box of JUST THESE off the Omaha site obviously as there's no point in doing that whatsoever, but I would have no problem eating them again just as long as they were included in a nicely priced packaged deal or sent free with a future order. I'll just make 2 at a time. In this case, I received 4 free, so it's hard to really complain all that much.",10,burger

"I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews for these burgers, I recently got an Omaha package for Christmas and I'm really enjoying most of the food,(didn't care for the beef stroganoff, and the beer battered fish fillets were nothing special) but the burgers, steaks(the top sirloins are excellent) and other red meats from Omaha are very good, not the ""best burger I've ever had"", but much better then the Safeway hamburger meat I typically use and better then fast food burgers. They are juicy and flavorful and easy to prepare, I live in the mountains and it's sometimes difficult to just run out and grab a burger, so I'm happy to have these in the freezer, I would call them restaurant quality burgers at home.",10,burger
"These aren't your grocery store burgers. The texture is not chop meat nothing like store bought burgers frozen or fresh. I have to agree with a lot of othet posters that these do cook up nice with that crispy crust and good color but they just don't taste very beefy. I prefer BJ's fresh ground patties in the meat counter. They are thick and have good flavor and also cook up nicely. These burgers aren't bad just not crazy about them, maybe the thicker ones have a stronger flavor.",10,burger
Do not waste your money. Low quality product sold by a shady company!! Overpaid for a very low quality box of dog food!!!,10,burger
I like the taste and texture of the burger. I would order more but they are expensive especially with the shipping costs.,10,burger
I expected these burgers to be better from the reviews. In the package they look great - fresh frozen with great deep red color. One good thing is that the do retain their size/shape after cooking. But the reason is because they are very lean so the fat doesn't cook out. The huge downside to that is fat = flavor. These were very dry because of the lack of fat to keep them moist and juicy. Unforunately I bought 20 burgers so I have a lot to eat. I will not buy them again.,10,burger
"We unloaded the gift box and my wife picked up the enclosed package of dry ice, she suffered burns on her fingers and hand. The product is inferior, meats are thin and price is excessive, I would never buy this under any circumstances. It is a biological hazard and should be discontinued.",10,burger
We have been buying from Omaha Steaks for a number of years and tonight we had our first real disappointment. We had two pork chops that came in our last order from Omaha steaks and they were just awful. I breaded them and then put them in the oven to continue cooking and they were so tough we could not even eat them. First time for such a bad experience.,10,burger
"Augratin potatoes had no cheese. First time we got them they were excellent, but this time bland and tasteless. Will never buy again.",10,burger
"I have a hectic job that doesn't often allow me a lunch break so Dr. McDougall's products work out great for me. I follow a high protein diet and this Black Bean soup is loaded with both fiber and protein without sacrificing taste. Just add boiling or very hot water and you can easily eat it at your desk as it takes up about as much space as a large coffee mug. Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet. There is minimal flavor change and a decrease (even though it may be slight) in sodium. I heartily recommend this soup for not only those on the go, but also for those who enjoy great soups. ",11,soup
"Tasty, fiber-rich and low fat, this instant lunch is also very filling.  The only thing holding me back from a perfect ""5"" rating is the relatively high sodium content, 660 mg. per package.  However,considering the 28 grams of fiber (112% of the daily requirement), I guess the trade-off is worth it.  Probably wouldn't taste as good without the salt anyway! ",11,soup
"Vegan. Natural. High protein. Nice black bean soup flavor. Becomes quick thick and hearty, especially for an instant cup type soup. Great with tortilla chips, wholegrain crackers, or a slice or two of crispbread. The lime and garlic flavor notes are mild and delicious. Great for warming up after any outdoor activity especially in chilly weather. Add a can of organic pintos (or other beans) and/or some diced veggies such as green bell peppers (or hot peppers) and tomatoes for added serving size. Can easy be used as a ready to go flavor maker for your own bean soup creations. Made with pre-cooked black beans, dehydrated veggies (garlic, onion, tomato, bell pepper), lime juice powder, cilantro, chipotle chili, cumin, coriander, black pepper, organic cane juice, yeast extract, natural flavors (vegan), and sea salt. Mix the flavor packet in the cup thoroughly before adding hot water. Let stand re-covered as recommended for 8+ minutes and then re-stir well.

"We tried this first with none at all of the so-called flavor packet, and then added a little tiny bit of the packet. Adding just a tiny bit of the packet was plenty. If one were to add the entire flavor packet it would be too salty. There is a lot of salt in this, but thankfully one can avoid that by not using the full flavor packet. We added a little less water than suggested, and still found it to be more watery than we liked. The easy solution, of course, is to add even less water. On the whole, if one does not use the flavor packet it is pretty decent. I have recently had the very expensive per oz shredded black beans from Barry Farms which I prefer to this - those are just pure black beans. The prize per oz for the Barry Farms item is very steep, however. ",11,soup
"This is the best instant soup ever!!  I have even let my meat eating friends try this soup, and they all think it is fantastic.  The soup has lots of flavor and lots of fiber.  Wonderful for a quick, filling lunch. ",11,soup
"I use the Black bean & lime soup for a quick meal at home for the family. I'll have some plain black beans with onion cooking in a crock pot and before the meal I'll pour one container of the Black bean soup/with seasoning into the crockpot to cook for 10 or 15 minutes.. Have it with rice and/or tortillas,avocado, and fresh tomato salsa(pulse some tomatoes, cilantro, sweet onion, cayenne, a little lime juice-whatever you like- in a blender)- a tasty,economical and very quick meal that serves 2 to 4. ",11,soup
"I love this soup!  Other than the sodium content, which I agree is a bit high, this is a great, healthy, filling, convenient lunch.  Just takes some good hot water and a little wrist action to mix it up well.  I love that one container has 28 grams of fiber, 10 grams of protein and only 2 sugars! I love that it's vegan, and that it has %14 of the daily requirement for iron.  Great little tasty lunch! ",11,soup
"My husband is vegan & eats this soup quite often for a quick lunch.  I also like it, but find it a bit spicy for my taste, so when I fix it, I just don't use all of the spice packet. ",11,soup
"To me, this soup tastes about as good as really great black bean side in a Mexican restaurant. It's easy to make and about as much fiber and protein you can get in something this size.  It can be a little lumpy if you don't mix well.  But, hey this is a 5 stars all the way.  I love it for breakfast even. ",11,soup
"As a non-meat eater deployed in a very meat-heavy environment, I was dying of hunger! I had eaten rice every day for 2 weeks unril I found this product. Food variety is hard when you are in the military and confined to eating what is provided or what is allowed to be shipped to where you are. I was so happy that Amazon shipped to my location. It was so easy to make and even my co-workers like it! I can't wait to get more! ",11,soup
"I have served this product to numerous friends of all ethnicities, ages, genders, and to people who think they're not going to like it because it comes in a carton.  I've served it to vegetarians and meat lovers.  I've served it cold, as a party dip. I've served it to my kids and grandkids and I've even given it as a Christmas gift.  Everybody has loved it and asked where they can get it.  Nothing but high praise thr this item. It is indistinguishable from beans that are cooked from scratch, and I am pleased that it is highly nutritious.  Definitely merits five stars! ",11,soup
"This soup is a great lunch at work- it's easy to make- just add hot water, it's very filling, and it's very good for you - lots of fiber and protien.  The bonus is it tastes great too. The lime adds a nice light taste- you don't always notice it, but when you do it's a nice surprise. Amazon has a great price and I love the subscribe and save. i have lunch delivered to my desk! ",11,soup
"I didn't really like this soup as I found it rather boring to eat. The lime flavoring was a good idea but it should have been a little more powerful you can only vaguely taste it in the soup if you concentrate. Overall, I dont think it had enough pizazz. If you like to eat plain beans you will like this but if not...I wouldn't recommend this one. ",11,soup
"This is the easiest and best black bean soup I have tasted!  Add a little sour cream, and it is complete.  It is creamy and smooth. ",11,soup
"I've had several of Dr. McDougall's soup cups and liked them all.  The taste on this was really good, but I was highly disappointed that there were two servings in this one cup. ",11,soup
"Too thick and too expensive. Honestly, you're better off blending up a can of black beans and seasoning/heating it to your taste. The seasoning in this product is barely discernible. ",11,soup
"This is delicious! I eat it plain, cook with it, let it thicken up and add it to rice for burrito filling, quick and tasty!! ",11,soup
"While the nutritional value of this vegan soup is excellent (only 2 grams of fat per cup and just 4 grams of sugar), the mixture falls flat. The lime and black bean taste is adequate, but when mixed with hot water, the beans turn to a nasty sludge-like mixture.  The texture is like paste and not very palatable. I tried the lighter McDouglall's Tortilla Soup and was more satisfied with its' aromatic smell and flavor. ",11,soup
"I make a habit of scrutinizing the hell out of everything I buy on Amazon, mostly via customer reviews. Many of the Dr. McDougall's line of foods were panned for awful flavor, so I was a little skittish....this, however, is quite good as well as quick, easy and filling. ",11,soup
"This soup packs a heft 10 grams of protein, which is excellent.  It also has flavor, a kind of spice created by the lime in it.  However, it's very thick and dark and it agglutinates at the bottom, like sea mud, so you need to stir it well deep down.  I use the whole packet of flavoring and do not find it watery -- exactly the opposite.  It's got 330 mg of sodium, but maybe the salt is needed to make this soup have any taste. ",11,soup
"I'm not vegan in any sense of the word, just looking for something tasty to eat while I'm at work. This fits the bill. It's easy to make and is very filling and flavorful. It could be a little spicier, but for something in a cup, I'm not going to complain. I would recommend this to anyone who wants something that isn't too bad for you on the go. ",11,soup
"Really tasty, but make sure you stir it as soon as you add the hot water. I was distracted and didn't stir it after pouring in hot water, and the top layer turned rather gelatinous, while the bottom layer remained a solid and partially in powder form. After I realized my mistake, I stirred like crazy and still managed to end up with a pretty tasty snack.  As a vegan, I'm happy to have found this brand of soup not in can form (BPA concerns). ",11,soup
"My daughter is vegan and it's hard to find things she will eat, this was a little pricey for dried soup, it was easily made according to microwave directions and she did like the taste but wished there were more whole beans in it. Four stars because of the price and lack of whole beans. ",11,soup
"I like Dr. McDougall's soups and often bring them to work when I want to eat a quick lunch, or have a satisfying snack that will help me feel satiated all afternoon. I like the taste and texture of this soup. I don't find that it's too thick or too thin as others have written. You can always add either more or less water to get the texture that you're looking for. Beware that this soup container has 2 servings of the soup and so all of the nutritional information has to be doubled when figuring how many calories and how much sodium you're taking in. What I typically do is add only half the flavor packet to the container of soup. This way, I significantly reduce the amount of sodium. The soup is very high in fiber, relatively low in fat and will keep you satisfied for hours. ",11,soup
"I have tried several flavors and I have to say for $1.50, it makes a nice lunch. Filling and better for you than most commercial soups or ramien noodles. It's dried soup, you get what you get. ",11,soup
"I've ordered this soup several times; both my husband and I enjoy it. However the seasonings tend to give me heartburn, so I use only about half the pack - still plenty of flavor, but with less frequent heartburn. Very filling due to high protein and fiber content; will be ordering this for years to come. ",11,soup
"This is the best dehydrated soup I have ever tasted. And it is packed with nutrients: 20g protein, 28g fiber, 60g carbs. Low sugar and moderate sodium. Very nutritous. I put it on a piece of chicken breast to make a stew - mmmm, good! Kind of expensive if you get it at the store, but Amazon's subscription program makes it very reasonable. ",11,soup
"When I read the name I thought it sounded like a questionable combination. Based on all the good reviews I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. I don't taste any lime, but it is a very flavorful soup. If you like black beans, you are bound to love this soup. I thought the package size sounded small, but it isn't. It's a very substantial, filling and satisfying meal. It is also lightweight to carry and simple to prepare. ",11,soup
"I have been buying these at my local health food store on sale which is sometimes cheaper than Amazon. But I wanted to buy a lot because we have been working so much lately that it has been really hard to get in good, quick, satisfying meals. The flavor of this soup is wonderful. The lime and cilantro make it very tasty and flavorful. I love most of the flavors, but like black bean and spring onion the best. My husband really loves the hot and sour, tamale and tortilla flavors. The black bean soup is super filling and I can definitely see why there are two servings in each cup. Sometimes I struggle to eat the whole thing unless I'm really hungry. Black beans are naturally high in calories but they are so good for you and have so much fiber (28g per cup). I really don't see why people have complained about the serving size/calorie content. I have never gained weight eating these and on the contrary have lost weight given the large amount of fiber. I have had to struggle with my weight in the past like many people and have come to realize that calories aren't worth counting if the food isn't really good for you in the first place. Overall, I really like this soup and when prepared correctly (add seasoning, stir, add boiling water, stir well, then cover for 8 minutes and stir again), it is absolutely delicious. ",11,soup
I love this soup a lot. It is a good portion. Healthy ingredients. Thick and full of flavor. It is just unbelievable that this is hot-water food! I have tried other McDougall's soups and this is by FAR the best (the ramen and noodle type soups are atrocious compared to their Black Bean Soup and their GREAT oatmeals). Highly recommended. Great dorm food for the college kids too. ,11,soup
"This soup is nice and thick unlike most insta-soups, and although some reviewers said it did not have enough lime, I can taste the hint of lime just fine. I really do love the consistency. Tons of fiber and protein, and super low in fat. It's what every girl needs! Don't try the tamale flavor, try this one! ",11,soup
You will LOVE this soup!  I had two people from work taste it and both of them loved it - one immediately went on line and ordered it from Amazon.com.  It's a hearty soup and leaves you satisfied. ,11,soup
I like to eat it at night when I work late because it is very satisfying and I don't wake up feeling faint. The spices in it make it very tasty as well and seems to be a great fat burner as well. ,11,soup
"easy to make a wonderful lunch with this. nice, nice, product. you feel good after eating this knowing it has quality ingredients and it is filling at a practical price. ",11,soup
It is so delicious and yummy!  I love its texture and spices make it a delightful meal anytime. Highly recommended! ,11,soup
It seems healthy enough from reading the ingredients. I find it a little bland so I add hot peppers. Also a few cashews for crunch. It also is good that way on top of a green salad. ,11,soup
"I was scared to order this due to some of the reviews. However the soup is quite good. I only added half the flavor packet due to everyone saying it was salty if you use the entire thing. I didn't have this problem and added the rest of the packet. Make sure you stir it well when you add hot water before letting it set otherwise you have hard beans at the bottom (my own fault). I don't get much lime flavor from it, which is better than being overpowered. I will be ordering this product again. ",11,soup
Dr. McDougall's soups are great for a meal or a snack break. Excellent flavor and Healthy!! Would buy again. Thanks Amazon! ,11,soup
Best instant soup Ive tried the taste is excellent perfect for lunch or when you don't have time to cook  and very filling I was surprised of how thick the soup got after adding the water will buy again ,11,soup
"This is a pretty good soup.  It usually comes out kind of lumpy which is expected when you are dealing with dried beans, but the taste is great!  I add some extra lime juice with some sliced avocado and tomato to get the perfect sized healthy meal. ",11,soup
My son does not like this as much as the tortilla soup but it is very good.  We use this as a base for other meals in while backpacking. ,11,soup
"These are great. They have a very subtle lime flavor, almost if at all. I would say there is more spice flavor than lime but I personally wouldnt call it spicy. Make sure your water is hot enough and keep stirring for minutes to make sure it mixes well. Sometimes I get crunchy overly dry beans so for the first time chew tenderly. But even beyond that, its still delicious and well worth the money if you want a satisfying and very easy to make snack that wont pack the pounds... ",11,soup
I buy four different soups regularly.  I am fortunate that I have normally low blood pressure.  My family cannot eat the soup because the sodium is way too high.  Reduce the sodium and this would be a 5. ,11,soup
"I especially like to combine it with brown rice for two easy and healthy meals.  I use it when others are having a high fat, high carb, high sugar meal full of chemicals I don't want, or just for convenience. ",11,soup
"but still excellent.  flavorful and very filling.  key is to stir them really well when adding hot water.  healthy and convenient.  haven't looked at sodium, but am guessing there is a lot... ",11,soup
"I really like these soups, but for me, the beans never really get fully softened.  I will buy them again. ",11,soup
Realy Really good... I love that bit of lime. Some of the best tasting black bean soup I have ever had. ,11,soup
"Delicious, but too pricey. How about a nice cheap sale like in the stores? Good for work, not so good health wise. ",11,soup
Great soup for on the go. So easy to prepare and eat when you need it the most. Flavorful tasty morsals. ,11,soup
"Oh, man that's good. The beans are mostly dissolved, like it cooked in the crockpot overnight. People complaining about the salt must be on a low-sodium diet with low-sodium taste buds, because it tastes pretty good to me. I can taste that touch of lime, too. The only thing I'd do different if it came out of my kitchen is add a bunch more cilantro. Ok, mine would have several more Scoville units, too, but some people are wusses who don't know what's good so I understand why they didn't market it that way. It's pretty close to perfect just like it is, though, so I'll be adding it to my monthly deliveries. ",11,soup
