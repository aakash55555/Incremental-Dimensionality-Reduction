learn the high-level coarse tokens, but we argue that a simple extraction
procedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics.
Such procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by
maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. In contrast to
the standard log- likelihood objective w.r.t. natural language tokens (word
perplexity), optimizing the joint log-likelihood biases the model towards
modeling high-level abstractions. We apply the proposed model to the task of
dialogue response generation in two challenging domains: the Ubuntu technical

adaptation to new environments. In the online learning setting, where new input
instances arrive sequentially in batches, the neuronal-birth is implemented by
adding new units with random initial weights (random dictionary elements); the
number of new units is determined by the current performance (representation
error) of the dictionary, higher error causing an increase in the birth rate.
Neuronal-death is implemented by imposing l1/l2-regularization (group sparsity)
on the dictionary within the block-coordinate descent optimization at each

name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the
medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the
medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the
fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same
drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset
sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a
single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although
many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems

interaction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions
between their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current
position. Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namely
Match-SRNN, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor is
constructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN is
applied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importance
determined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculated
based on the global interaction. We show that, after degenerated to the exact

of the tables and query words can be learned from scratch. The training can be
done in an end-to-end fashion, but it can take stronger guidance, e.g., the

limited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose
TreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a

Typically, a significant amount of human insight and preparation is required
prior to executing machine learning algorithms. For example, when creating deep
neural networks, the number of parameters must be selected in advance and
furthermore, a lot of these choices are made based upon pre-existing knowledge
of the data such as the use of a categorical cross entropy loss function.
Humans are able to study a dataset and decide whether it represents a

if a dataset represents a classification or a regression problem. We test API
on 16 different classification, regression and sentiment analysis datasets with
up to 10,000 features and up to 17,000 unique target values. API achieves an

the use of $\ell_1$ penalties to enforce sparseness. To the best of our

applications. The representation of spatial knowledge is often modeled with
spatial templates, i.e., regions of acceptability of two objects under an
explicit spatial relationship (e.g., ""on"", ""below"", etc.). In contrast with
prior work that restricts spatial templates to explicit spatial prepositions
(e.g., ""glass on table""), here we extend this concept to implicit spatial
language, i.e., those relationships (generally actions) for which the spatial
arrangement of the objects is only implicitly implied (e.g., ""man riding
horse""). In contrast with explicit relationships, predicting spatial
arrangements from implicit spatial language requires significant common sense
spatial understanding. Here, we introduce the task of predicting spatial
templates for two objects under a relationship, which can be seen as a spatial
question-answering task with a (2D) continuous output (""where is the man w.r.t.
a horse when the man is walking the horse?""). We present two simple
neural-based models that leverage annotated images and structured text to learn
this task. The good performance of these models reveals that spatial locations
are to a large extent predictable from implicit spatial language. Crucially,
the models attain similar performance in a challenging generalized setting,
where the object-relation-object combinations (e.g.,""man walking dog"") have
never been seen before. Next, we go one step further by presenting the models
with unseen objects (e.g., ""dog""). In this scenario, we show that leveraging
word embeddings enables the models to output accurate spatial predictions,

novel deep architecture for multimodal sentiment analysis that performs
modality fusion at the word level. In this paper, we propose the Gated
Multimodal Embedding LSTM with Temporal Attention (GME-LSTM(A)) model that is

importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of
applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in
our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities,
resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated
sense of their capability.
  We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance
the popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that every
question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image,
but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the
question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA
dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our
complete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part of
the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA
v2.0).
  We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced
dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset,
suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors.
This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to
be a qualitative sense among practitioners.
  Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images
enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to
providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a
counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is
similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the
same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.","Making the V in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in

allowed to obtain efficient algorithms but also important theoretical results,
including convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations
of model sparsity.
  In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method based
on a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to accelerate the
convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused
on a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the
specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some
classic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM
algorithms.
  On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the
guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by
using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of
convergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms.
  On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification
datasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments show
that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works
well even in the cases in which classic away steps slow down the algorithm.

learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding

both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters
from the TNet itself. Extensive experiments show that our ZM-Net can perform

misclassification loss (i.e. the logistic loss used in logistic regression) is
minimized. We show: (a) when the dropout-regularized criterion has a unique

special class of initial conditions on the weights, very deep networks incur
only a finite, depth independent, delay in learning speed relative to shallow

sparse pointer network aimed at capturing very long-range dependencies. We
release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code
crawled from GitHub. On this corpus, we found standard neural language models
to perform well at suggesting local phenomena, but struggle to refer to
identifiers that are introduced many tokens in the past. By augmenting a neural
language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined
classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage
points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline.
In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more
accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows
this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring
to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.",Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,2016

demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and
the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between
the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the
conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better
performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance
improvements independent of which architecture is used.",Conditional Generation and Snapshot Learning in Neural Dialogue Systems,2016

accurately estimate a compact representation of the current dialog status from
a sequence of noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the
natural language understanding modules. This paper introduces a novel method of
dialog state tracking based on the general paradigm of machine reading and
proposes to solve it using an End-to-End Memory Network, MemN2N, a
memory-enhanced neural network architecture. We evaluate the proposed approach
on the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. The corpus has
been converted for the occasion in order to frame the hidden state variable
inference as a question-answering task based on a sequence of utterances
extracted from a dialog. We show that the proposed tracker gives encouraging
results. Then, we propose to extend the DSTC-2 dataset with specific reasoning
capabilities requirement like counting, list maintenance, yes-no question
answering and indefinite knowledge management. Finally, we present encouraging
results using our proposed MemN2N based tracking model.","Dialog state tracking, a machine reading approach using Memory Network",2016

drifts of localized and labelled content in statistical models of evolving
semantics represented as a vector field. This articulates the need to detect,
measure, interpret and model outcomes of knowledge dynamics. To this end we
employ a high-performance machine learning algorithm for the training of
extremely large emergent self-organizing maps for exploratory data analysis.
The working hypothesis we present here is that the dynamics of semantic drifts
can be modeled on a relaxed version of Newtonian mechanics called social
mechanics. By using term distances as a measure of semantic relatedness vs.
their PageRank values indicating social importance and applied as variable
`term mass', gravitation as a metaphor to express changes in the semantic
content of a vector field lends a new perspective for experimentation. From
`term gravitation' over time, one can compute its generating potential whose
fluctuations manifest modifications in pairwise term similarity vs. social
importance, thereby updating Osgood's semantic differential. The dataset
examined is the public catalog metadata of Tate Galleries, London.",A Physical Metaphor to Study Semantic Drift,2016

state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. Although
ANNs do not require manually engineered features, ANNs have many
hyperparameters to be optimized. The choice of hyperparameters significantly
impacts models' performances. However, the ANN hyperparameters are typically
chosen by manual, grid, or random search, which either requires expert
experiences or is computationally expensive. Recent approaches based on
Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (GPs) is a more systematic way
to automatically pinpoint optimal or near-optimal machine learning
hyperparameters. Using a previously published ANN model yielding
state-of-the-art results for dialog act classification, we demonstrate that
optimizing hyperparameters using GP further improves the results, and reduces
the computational time by a factor of 4 compared to a random search. Therefore
it is a useful technique for tuning ANN models to yield the best performances
for natural language processing tasks.","Optimizing Neural Network Hyperparameters with Gaussian Processes for

and waiting for system to give translated output in desired form. In this
paper, we present the Acoustic Dialect Decoder (ADD) - a voice to voice
ear-piece translation device. We introduce and survey the recent advances made
in the field of Speech Engineering, to employ in the ADD, particularly focusing
on the three major processing steps of Recognition, Translation and Synthesis.
We tackle the problem of machine understanding of natural language by designing
a recognition unit for source audio to text, a translation unit for source
language text to target language text, and a synthesis unit for target language
text to target language speech. Speech from the surroundings will be recorded
by the recognition unit present on the ear-piece and translation will start as
soon as one sentence is successfully read. This way, we hope to give translated
output as and when input is being read. The recognition unit will use Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs) Based Tool-Kit (HTK), hybrid RNN systems with gated memory
cells, and the synthesis unit, HMM based speech synthesis system HTS. This
system will initially be built as an English to Tamil translation device.",A Survey of Voice Translation Methodologies - Acoustic Dialect Decoder,2016
